##  What to Keep In Mind When Buying an Android Smartwatch In 2024

 Wearable technology sales are steadily growing year-on-year, and smartwatches take up nearly 60 percent of this niche market. The Apple Watch remains the bestseller, but Android smartwatches from brands like Samsung and Garmin compete with their offerings of advanced health and fitness tracking, smart home integration, and continuous connectivity through calls and messaging.

 The key features you need to consider depend on your personal goals and choices. People generally buy smartwatches for their health and wellness features, so make sure your chosen watch has all the relevant functions. Most decent Android smartwatches will provide acceptable fitness tracking at worst. But if you’re a serious outdoors type, you’ll also need [excellent battery life](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/maximize-your-online-presence-with-these-5-streaming-techniques/). On top of that, proven durability, accurate GPS tracking, good water resistance, and a bright display you can see when sunlight is intense are desirable features.

 Comfort is another crucial aspect. Fitness enthusiasts won’t want an overly bulky watch, but neither will anyone who uses a smartwatch to track their sleep. Read customer reviews to determine if the watch is comfortable for daytime and all-night wear. You should also check to see if the watch band is [customizable](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-forgotten-the-voicemail-password-of-vivo-v30-lite-5g-try-these-fixes-by-drfone-android/), as you might want to change the material in the hot summer months.

 A customizable watch face is also an appealing feature, and a user-friendly interface is always welcome. You don’t want to buy a slow-performing watch, either. Ensure it has a good processor and enough RAM for its features to operate smoothly. A standard smartwatch will need between 512MB and 1GB of RAM to operate efficiently, with more advanced models requiring 1.5 to 2GB.

 It’s also important that your smartwatch has [access to the apps you want](https://change-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-xiaomi-13-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/). Some [low-cost smartwatches](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-deciphering-the-disappearance-of-recommended-video-content-in-your-newsfeed/) may not support 3rd party apps, meaning you’ll only have access to the options that come with the watch. This is particularly true for dedicated fitness trackers, so this is something to consider if you want to avoid the [mistakes smartwatch users commonly make](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-understanding-the-mechanics-how-to-follow-facebook-live/).

 Lastly, [overall value is essential](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-proven-ways-in-how-to-hide-location-on-life360-for-huawei-p60-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) for most people. It’s all very well going out and purchasing the latest and greatest. But if you’re not going to use the advanced features of the watch, then it probably isn’t worth handing over the extra hundreds of dollars. Think carefully about what you need from your Android smartwatch and choose one that balances value and the features you need.

 The [Samsung Galaxy Watch 7](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D1YP5ZQB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) has arrived for health-conscious smartphone users. The most significant upgrade to the [Galaxy Watch 6](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Bluetooth-Smartwatch-Personalized-Advanced/dp/B0C792QRW6?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is the new Exynos W1000 chipset, the much-anticipated 3nm debut in a Galaxy Watch. Samsung has made some huge performance improvements with a three times faster CPU and 30 percent more power efficiency. Another notable upgrade is the 32GB of storage, which is double the previous capacity.

 However, the advanced health monitoring features make the Galaxy Watch7 stand out against its competitors. The sleep tracking with AI-powered insights is particularly impressive in its level of detail and includes a new sleep apnea detection feature. Furthermore, Advanced Glycation End Products Index tracking enables unique features like biological age assessment for wellness management. Other core health features of the watch are heart monitoring, body composition analysis, and stress management.

 While it is an Android smartwatch, pairing it with a Samsung phone is still the best option despite the fact that it runs on [Wear OS 5](https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/quick-guide-getting-the-latest-thrustmaster-t150-driver-software-downloaded/). If you have a phone running on Android 11 or higher, you can still pair it with the watch, but you will miss out on some more advanced features.

 It's available in [40-](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D1YP5ZQB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) and [44-mm](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D1YMB2GW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) sizes, and they both retain the stylish circular design of earlier Galaxy Watches. However, neither features the popular rotating physical bezel some previous models sported. The Galaxy Watch7 features a digital bezel and has a lightweight profile, with the 40mm weighing just 1oz (28.8g) and the 44mm variation slightly heavier at 1.2oz (33.8g). Color options are limited to green, silver, or cream, but the watch bands and faces are customizable.

 Both models offer military-grade durability and 5ATM and IP68 ratings, which technically means you can submerge them in water. However, Samsung states the watches are unsuitable for scuba diving or other water sports. Samsung also says the 425mAh battery on the 44mm model will last up to 40 hours; the 40mm model features a smaller battery at 300mAh. However, there have been [battery issues reported](https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/efficient-date-adding-strategies-for-photos-for-2024/) and it’s worth keeping an eye on developments.

 You might be wondering [what the differences are with the new Galaxy Watch Ultra](https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/new-how-to-amplify-your-contents-impact-a-tiktok-hashtag-guide-for-2024/). Well, first and foremost, the [Galaxy Watch Ultra](https://amazon.com/dp/B0D7DWFDXB?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is a more premium option. But if you’re after more ruggedness, you might opt for this more advanced model. With features such as Multi-Sports Mode and an emergency siren, it’s geared more toward those who like to partake in more arduous physical activities. It’s also bigger and heavier, features an indomitable titanium chassis, and an even larger and longer-lasting battery.

| Pros                              | Cons                                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Easy-to-use interface             | Lacks 3rd-party app compatibility    |
| Comfortable to wear when sleeping | Some heart rate monitor inaccuracies |
| Outstanding 6-day battery life    | No Wi-Fi connectivity                |
| Excellent sleep-tracking features |                                      |
| Good value                        |                                      |

 The [Fitbit Versa 4](https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4N6B93J?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) specifically aims for health-conscious smartwatch lovers seeking a more affordable Android option. With its slim and comfortable design, this smartwatch is ideal for all-day and all-night wear. In fact, it makes an excellent sleep tracker on top of its impressive fitness features.

 With its intuitive touchscreen interface, users can easily access the plethora of functions while working out or preparing to hit the hay. Accuracy is good, for the most part, with distance traveled, pace, and calories burned all comparable to more premium watch measurements. It will also give you detailed information on when to work out and when to take a rest. Additionally, its suggestions on how to keep your workouts fresh help you avoid getting stuck in boring routines. However, heart rate readings can sometimes be inconsistent and even plain inaccurate.

 Yet, it is a strong contender when it comes to sleep tracking. On top of the comfort the flush-against-your-wrist fit provides, it has plenty of tools you can use to measure and improve your quality of sleeping. The watch supplies detailed information on slumberland stages, including the time you spend awake. It delivers a daily score and features a smart alarm that calculates the optimal time to wake you up during your lightest sleep. Its monthly report even assigns you an animal representing your sleeping behavior.

 However, with a lack of third-party apps and no actual app store to speak of, the Fitbit Sense 4 faces limitations in terms of compatibility. App availability is more restricted than that of more premium smartwatches and their well-stocked app stores.

 The [Garmin Fenix 7](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-02540-00-Fenix-Smartwatch-Microfiber/dp/B09QYVMYGK?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is primarily aimed at athletes and outdoor enthusiasts in the market for a high-performance, rugged, and feature-rich smartwatch. Consequently, it is a prime device for fitness tracking. The Fenix 7 series is available in several different models, and choosing the right one can be confusing. In general, the standard Fenix 7 is ideal if your focus is only on fitness tracking.

 At 47mm, the Fenix 7 is bigger than the [Fenix 7S](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-02540-00-Fenix-Smartwatch-Microfiber/dp/B09QYJ61LM?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) (42mm), smaller than the [7X Sapphire Solar](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-02540-00-Fenix-Smartwatch-Microfiber/dp/B09QXVG8G5?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) (51mm), and comparable in size to the [Fenix 7 Sapphire Solar](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-010-02540-00-Fenix-Smartwatch-Microfiber/dp/B09QYWF7PR?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). And we haven’t even mentioned the [Fenix 7 Pro series](https://www.amazon.com/Garmin-Multisport-Smartwatch-Flashlight-Capability/dp/B0BYFC8G18?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce). All Fenix 7 models feature a touchscreen and physical button controls, but the Solar editions unsurprisingly [feature solar charging](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-guiding-iphone-and-android-owners-to-fix-video-sending-problems-in-fb-chat/) and ultra-tough sapphire glass.

 In terms of fitness tracking, the Fenix 7 has all the tools you could need. But don’t think it will put you through the paces as if you have just signed up for the military. It helps you to understand your current fitness and set realistic goals. It will also help you to achieve these goals in a sustainable manner.

 The watch excels in providing data-driven insights to optimize training. With detailed metrics, personalized workouts, and recovery guidance, you can make informed decisions vital for preventing overtraining. The heart rate monitor is very accurate, and features like ClimbPro and PacePro help you manage your pacing without hitting it too hard—or too lightly, for that matter.

 It also excels in navigation, with pinpoint-accurate GPS tracking and multi-GNSS support, detailed topographic maps with elevation data and terrain features, essential orientation tools, waypoint creation, route planning, and breadcrumb navigation for easy backtracking. Along with its exceptional (up to)18-day battery life, it’s an [indispensable companion when hiking](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-bypassing-barriers-privately-share-youtube-video-via-google-for-2024/) or doing activities in remote places and is ideal for day-to-day fitness and health tracking.

With the [TickTalk 5](https://www.amazon.com/TickTalk5-Cellular-Smart-Tracker-Calling/dp/B0CRTDT5NH?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004607&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-android-smartwatches%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) kids’ smartwatch, you can also keep tabs on where they are when playing outside. Additionally, you can communicate with your kids whenever you need to, and many integrated safety features ensure parental worry is kept to a minimum.

 While it may be a little bulky for some wrists, the watch is designed for 5-12-year-old children. Its [IP67 dust and water-resistant](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/how-artificer-intelligence-redefines-what-we-perceive-as-real-or-just-a-story/) and shockproof design make it a rugged choice to get through the trials and tribulations kids may put it through. Additionally, the display is crisp and sharp, and the battery life can last up to five days.

 The setup process is straightforward, and TickTalk provides instructions and QR scanning with videos if you encounter any problems. The watch uses a 4G network for connectivity, ensuring prevalent coverage. A monthly subscription is required, but there is no contract, and month-to-month payments are very low.

 Crucially, the all-important GPS tracking is precise. This key feature delivers accurate real-time tracking and reviews previous routes, but it’s important to keep the software updated to maintain this accuracy.

 Communication includes two-way voice calls, SOS emergency calls, video calling, and voice-to-text messaging. Call quality is excellent, with crisp, clear voices, and the HD video function works well. Parents also have complete control of the watch via the app. You can set communication with pre-approved contacts only and set reminders for kids, such as prompting them when it’s time to come home.

 There are also health and wellness features where you can set daily goals for children, such as steps taken and active hours. This is an excellent addition to ensure kids get the daily exercise they need. When goals are met, the watch emphasizes the achievement with some celebratory fanfare.

 The watch also provides entertainment options with free music streaming. Children in the US can also stream podcasts and stories from iHeart Radio Family, and another fun feature for children is the 5MP camera that can snap daily photos of their activities.

### Do you need an Android phone to use an Android smartwatch?

 For best results, you should pair an Android smartwatch with an Android smartphone. However, it’s not completely necessary. Android smartwatches can still pair with iPhones, but functionality will likely be limited to the basics, such as notifications, fitness tracking, and call handling.

### Can I use an Apple Watch with an Android phone?

 The Apple Watch is designed for iPhones. So, no, you unfortunately cannot use an Apple Watch with an Android phone. 

### Will my smartwatch work if I leave my phone at home?

 Yes, if your watch supports Wi-Fi or cellular connectivity. A watch without these options will need to be accompanied by your smartphone. However, this is only for connectivity. Many smartwatches offer standalone features like fitness tracking, music playback, and even app usage without a smartphone connection.

### Do Android smartwatches have cameras?

 Most smartwatches do without a built-in camera. Some models designed for kids feature a low-resolution camera for fun. But, generally speaking, it’s pretty rare to find one much better than that. However, they can be found, just don’t expect to be gracing the pages of National Geographic with one.
