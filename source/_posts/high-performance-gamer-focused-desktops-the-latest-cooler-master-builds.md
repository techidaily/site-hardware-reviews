## High-Performance, Gamer-Focused Desktops: The Latest Cooler Master Builds

Cooler Master's new preconfigured PCs have plenty of oomph to render today's triple-A titles in 4K resolution, and run the most demanding applications such as video editing. They also deliver sustained maximum performance, thanks to superior cooling with the company's MasterLiquid cooling solution.

 Cooler Master offers a bunch of [weird PC cases](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/foremost-gallery-storage-solutions-for-2024/), including one that looks like a robot's shoe, as well as other PC components like mice, keyboards, etc. If you're a gamer or someone who does a lot of video editing, consider Cool Master's new already-configured systems. I know many people prefer to build their dream gaming rig, but Cooler Master now offers a pair of computers equipped with all the required hardware that guarantees you'll be able to play graphically demanding titles.

 The new HAF 5 Pro and NR2 Pro leverage Cooler Master's cooling technology to deliver sustained performance and use high-end components, making these systems capable of handling gaming and professional workloads. While the NR2 Pro balances a small footprint and exceptional performance, the flagship HAF 5 Pro delivers smooth and reliable performance across all applications.

###  NR2 Pro

* **CPU and GPU:** Intel Core i9-14900K processor and NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 Super graphics card
* **Memory:** 64GB DDR5-5600MHz RAM
* **Storage:** 2TB NVMe Gen 4 SSD
* **Cooling:** 280mm Cooler Master AIO liquid cooler and third-generation CPU pump

###  HAF 5 Pro

* **CPU and GPU:** Latest Intel Core processors and NVIDIA GeForce RTX graphics
* **Memory:** 16GB DDR4-3200MHz RAM
* **Storage:** 1TB NVMe M.2 PCIe SSD
* **Cooling:** The Hyper 212 heat pipe technology

 The NR2 Pro is a real workhorse thanks to as many as 24 processing cores in Intel's i9-14900K chip arranged in eight performance and sixteen efficiency clusters, with 32 logical threads. The CPU can boost its frequency to 6GHz when need be. The RTX 4080 graphcis that the CPU is paired with delivers AI-enhanced [DLSS image enhancement and upscaling technology](https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/add-music-in-premiere-pro-for-2024/) and features a dedicated NVENC encoder that doesn't burden the GPU.

 The HAF 5 Pro's CPU has eight performance cores, four efficient cores, 20 logical threads (16 on the performance cores and four on the efficient cores), and up to 4.9 GHz clock speed.

 The HAF 5 Pro is available in these five configurations on Amazon:

 The NR2 Pro was unavailable to order at publication time, so keep an eye on Cool Master's Amazon store or the [official Cool Master website](https://www.coolermaster.com/) for availability information. Cool Master recently got some bad press for [leaking customer data in a data breach](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-prime-video-to-text-technology-now/) that occurred on May 19, but it doesn't look like any delicate credit card information was compromised.
