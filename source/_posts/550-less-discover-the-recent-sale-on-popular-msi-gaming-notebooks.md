Aside from the sleek design and display, there's a lot to unpack about this laptop, including the 8-core processor that can boost up to 4.60GHz for ultimate performance. You'll also get 16GB RAM and a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU to enhance your imagery while gaming. 

Fun fact -- I use a GS Stealth as my main professional laptop, and can personally attest to how great this laptop line is. I love being able to carry it on the go, and because of the design, it's not glaringly a gaming laptop. Plus, it can still pack a punch when I need to boot up my games.

For those that might be nervous about a 3060 GPU, the graphics on my Stealth model are beautiful, too, offering detailed picture for AAA games like Death Stranding and the Far Cry franchise. I personally also pair my Stealth with the [SteelSeries Nova Pro Wireless gaming headset](https://prf.hn/click/camref:1101l9Prx/pubref:zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fsteelseries.com%2Fgaming-headsets%2Farctis-nova-pro-wireless%3F) and [a vertical gaming mouse](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FErgonomic-Programmable-Buttons-Vertical-PC-Sports%2Fdp%2FB07THFMNQ2%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C5c5ae517-491a-4bb0-8307-9525aa468eb4%7Cdtp&dtb=1) for ultimate gameplay.
