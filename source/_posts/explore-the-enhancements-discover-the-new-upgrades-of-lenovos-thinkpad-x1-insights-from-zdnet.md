Intel recently announced its 13th Gen Intel Core i9 desktop processors, but hasn't announced their mobile counterparts. The 2022 ThinkPad X1 also came with Core i5 and Core i7 mobile processors.

Lenovo points to updates to features like Lenovo View as a result of the shift to hybrid work. "Collaboration features like auto-framing, background concealment, and virtual presenter upgrade those on-camera calls to make the presenter front and center," it said.
