A webcam can be a great way to add higher production values to your pre-recorded content and live streams, as well as an excellent way to show off your personality and connect with your audience.

Many webcams feature plug-and-play compatibility with most Windows devices as well as MacOS and Linux computers. But to take full advantage of special features like automatic brightness boosting and white balance, you may need to download proprietary desktop apps.

## HyperX Vision S

### Best webcam for streaming overall

 HyperX's first webcam, the Vision S, is my go-to for everything from Zoom calls for work, to Discord movie nights with friends, and whenever I get a free moment to actually stream on Twitch. The wide, 90-degree field-of-view gives you plenty of framing space to set up interesting backgrounds like neon signs or reactive RGB lighting without making you feel cramped on-screen. 

**Also: [The best lights for streaming on Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-streaming-light/)** 

It can record and live stream in up to 4K resolution at 30 frames per second, and at up to 60fps at 1080p HD. It connects to your PC via USB, and features plug-and-play compatibility with Windows, ChromeOS, and MacOS devices. This means you don't have to download any extra software or apps to start using your Vision S, but to be able to take full advantage of features like in-camera white balance, you'll need the HyperX NGenuity desktop app. And with a magnetic privacy cover, you can quickly cover the lens when not in use to prevent accidental recordings or unauthorized viewing.

**HyperX Vision S features - Resolution:** Up to 4K | **Field of view:** 90 degrees | **Framerate:** Up to 30 fps at 4K, up to 60 fps at 1080p | **Connectivity:** USB | **Compatibility:** Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS

### Best budget webcam for streaming

 If you're just starting out on YouTube, Twitch, or TikTok, the Logitech Brio 100 is a great, affordable webcam option. It retails under $50, making it one of the cheapest on the market while still offering 1080p resolution and a 30 fps frame rate. It connects to your computer via USB, and has plug-and-play support for Windows, Mac, and Chromebook laptops.

**Also: [Want to create better TikToks and Reels? You need one of these ring lights](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/best-ring-light/)** 

A built-in privacy shutter lets you block the lens when not in use to prevent spying or unauthorized recording. The Brio 100 also uses Logitech's RightLight algorithm to automatically boost output brightness in dim environments, letting you look your best without having to invest in expensive lighting equipment. And with the Logi Option+ desktop app, you can create custom settings for autofocus and more for faster setup during recording or live streaming.

Pros 
* 3-axis gimbal for pan-and-zoom
* AI-assisted tracking
* Gesture controls
* Overhead and desk top view settings

Cons 
* Expensive
* Runs warm

## Insta360 Link

### Best 4K webcam for streaming

The Insta360 Link is a 4K webcam that can pull double-duty for work and live streaming. It features a 3-axis gimbal head which allows it to pan side-to-side, up and down, and diagonally. And with an AI-assisted tracking algorithm, you'll always be center-frame. The Insta360 Link even has overhead and desk-view positioning settings, which automatically move the lens to focus on your table top for art streams, model-building, or miniature painting. 

ZDNET's Kerry Wan got to go hands-on with the [Insta360 Link](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/insta360-link-review/), and compares the video output quality from the half-inch sensor to that of a DSLR camera. He also praised the ultra-fast autofocus as well as its consistency with detecting objects close to the camera.

**Insta360 Link features - Resolution:** 4K | **Field of view:** 79.5 degrees | **Framerate:** 30fps | **Connectivity:** USB-C | **Compatibility:** Windows, MacOS

## GoPro Hero 12 Black

### Best action webcam for streaming

GoPro is far and away the top name in action cameras, and the Hero 12 Black is the absolute best you can buy for content creation. It can record video in up to 5.3K resolution at up to 60fps or at up to 240fps at 1080p. And with the truly ultra-wide 177-degree field-of-view, you'll be able to capture more action or landscape shots. 

Travel vloggers and sports content creators will love the long battery life: up to 70 minutes of continuous shooting at 5.3K/60fps or over 2.5 hours recording at 1080p/30fps. ZDNET's Adrian Kingsley-Hughes got to test out the [GoPro Hero 12 Black](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/3-reasons-the-gopro-hero-12-black-is-my-new-favorite-action-camera/), and was able to get similar run times. Though he does recommend bringing along extra batteries or an external power source for long-form videos like time lapses or all-day shoots. 

**GoPro Hero 12 Black features – Resolution:** Up to 5K | **Field of view:** 177 degrees | **Framerate:** Up to 240fps | **Connectivity:** USB-C, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth | **Compatibility:** Windows, MacOS, Linux

### Best high-end webcam for streaming

Logitech's new Mevo Core has a micro 4/3 image sensor that outperforms typical webcams in low light and resolution, and comes with an HDMI port, two USB-C ports, and is Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth capable. This capability is handy as it allows you to manage the camera with the Mevo Multicam mobile app, making changing camera zoom, focus, and exposure settings quick and easy. It also touts having an AI Auto-Director to allow streamers and content creators with multiple Mevo Core cameras to switch views and camera angles.

**Also: [Need a green screen? Take your videos to the next level with our top picks](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-green-screen/)** 

The image quality on the Mevo Core is outstanding; this is not your average webcam. You can expect better performance in low light, but the performance in controlled lighting, such as in a home studio, is top-tier. This is the webcam for seasoned creators with an established history and workflow that are looking to upgrade their existing set. Due to pricing, it's harder to recommend the Mevo Core to newer creators and streamers, especially if you're on a budget. 

**Logitech Mevo Core features - Resolution:** 1080p | **Field of view:** 90 degrees | **Framerate:** 60fps | **Connectivity:** HDMI, two USB-C ports | **Compatibility:** Windows, MacOS

Pros 
* Ultra-portable
* Plug-and-go setup
* 30 fps at 4K
* Directional mic

Cons 
* Only works on laptops
* One way to mount with no adjustment

## Opal Tadpole

### Best webcam for streaming for laptop users

The Opal Tadpole takes portability to the next level as a minimalist 1.2-inch square webcam designed to clip right onto your laptop. Lightweight design aside, the Tadpole has impressive image quality and shoots in 4K, working particularly well in environments with low or inconsistent lighting. This, along with its directional mic designed to only pick up sound coming from the camera's field of view make it well-suited for noisy environments.

**Review: [Opal Tadpole](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-used-the-smallest-webcam-ever-built-and-its-surprisingly-versatile/)** 

The camera comes attached to a premium woven cable with an attachable bead that stays tight to the laptop, eliminating loose cords for maximum portability. The Tadpole is ultimately designed for the streamer that has mobility in mind, and wants high-quality video anywhere they can take their laptop.

**Opal Tadpole features - Resolution:** Up to 4K | **Field of view:** 70 degrees | **Framerate:** Up to 30 fps at 4K | **Connectivity:** USB-C | **Compatibility:** Windows, MacOS

## What is the best streaming webcam?

I've chosen the HyperX Vision S as my pick for the best webcam for streaming. It's capable of up to 4K output resolution at up to 30 fps. It features a mounting hinge for placing it on a laptop or desktop monitor, or you can thread it onto a tripod for more placement options. It also has a durable aluminum body and magnetic privacy cover for durability and security when not in use.

## Which is the right streaming webcam for you?

Really any webcam will be just fine for both streaming newcomers and seasoned pros. But if you're looking for specifics, a webcam that is capable of at least 30fps and recording in 1080p will give you the clearest video, even over slower internet connections. More budget-friendly models usually top out at 720p resolution, which is alright for beginners learning the ropes, but may put off audience members who prefer higher quality face cam videos. 

| HyperX Vision S     | A well-rounded webcam. The HyperX Vision S gives you a wide field of view and crisp resolution even in low lighting.             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## How did we choose these streaming webcams?

While researching and testing each webcam on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind: 

* **Resolution** – While a 720p webcam will do the job, many creators (even absolute beginners) will invest in webcams and other equipment that will be able to adapt as their needs change. I've made sure that each webcam on this list is capable of at least 1080p HD resolution.
* **Price** – You don't have to spend a fortune on a fancy, high-end webcam to get quality video output for your livestream or recorded video. I've made sure to include budget-friendly and mid-range options for beginners and smaller creators with more modest production budgets.
* **Compatibility** – No two creators will have the exact same setup. Some prefer Windows or Linux while others choose MacOS. Each webcam on this list has been checked for compatibility with a variety of operating systems and streaming/recording software packages.

## Does my stream quality depend on webcam resolution?

Your webcam's output resolution does have an effect on your stream quality, but it's not quite as impactful as your bitrate and internet upload speeds. While having a 4K webcam will do wonders for your production values, it may actually be a detriment to your streams if your internet isn't able to keep up with such high-quality output. 

Video output quality also depends on how well-lit your recording or streaming space is. If you're having trouble creating quality streams, even with a 720p or 1080p HD webcam, you may need to try out [different lighting setups](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-home/best-strip-lights/) to capture clean, crisp video and stills. 

## What is a VTuber?

Vtuber is a portmanteau/abbreviation for "virtual youtuber," and refers to content creators that use an animated avatar as the "face" of their channel or page rather than their IRL selves. Some creators choose to become a VTuber in order to create a fun character and lore for their channel and audience engagement, while others use an avatar and character to add an extra layer of security and anonymity to protect their real identities from bad faith actors in their communities. 

While VTubers are most popular in Japan, English-speaking creators like [Nyanners](https://www.twitch.tv/nyanners) and [IronMouse](https://www.twitch.tv/ironmouse) have helped popularize the idea in the US.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## What is a PTZ camera? Do I need one to be a VTuber?

PTZ stands for "pan, tilt, zoom," and a PTZ camera can be an asset to a VTuber's streaming setup, but it isn't required. A PTZ camera makes it easier to center your face and/or body in the frame, which is essential for VTuber model animation programs like [VSeeFace](https://www.vseeface.icu/) to create smooth, more realistic movements. 

If you're a VTuber that uses a bust model (from the shoulders-up), a PTZ camera isn't necessary, since you'll be either seated or standing in a single spot and framed well within your current webcam's output. But if you use a full-body model for dancing or [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/), you may want to invest in a PTZ camera to help reduce the possibility of animation errors as you move around your space. 

## Can I use my phone as a webcam?

You can absolutely use your smartphone as a webcam for work or livestreaming. Whether you use an iOS device, Android, or Windows phone, with the right desktop app, you can take advantage of your device's built-in front and rear cameras for higher resolution video for live streaming. 

If you want a step-by-step guide, you can check out our walkthrouhs for setting up a phone with [Windows](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-your-phone-as-a-webcam-in-windows/) and [MacOS Ventura](https://www.zdnet.com/article/macos-ventura-how-to-use-your-iphone-as-a-webcam-with-continuity-camera/).
