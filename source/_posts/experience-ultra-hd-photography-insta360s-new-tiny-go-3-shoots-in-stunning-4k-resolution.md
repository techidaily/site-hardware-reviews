## Experience Ultra-HD Photography: Insta360's New Tiny Go 3 Shoots in Stunning 4K Resolution

A 4K Dolby Vision action camera that's smaller than your thumb. That's the pitch behind Insta360's Go 3S camera, an upgraded version of the 2.7K-capable GO 3 that launched last year.

 The original Insta360 Go 3 fared well in [our review](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-guide-to-productive-online-team-sessions/) last year, scoring an 8/10\. While the camera's app was somewhat cumbersome, the hardware itself was more or less immaculate, offering flexible and intuitive on-the-go recording in an ultra-portable package. Its so-called "Action Pod," a detachable touchscreen monitor that charges the extends the camera's battery life, also proved to be an essential accessory.

 Yes, the original Go 3 camera was great, but I'm still stunned by the number of upgrades in this new release. The Insta360 GO 3S retains the flexible form factor of its predecessor, but it gains 4K video, Apple Find My tracking, and automatic aspect ratio switching (you can turn the camera to switch from vertical to horizontal shooting). It's also waterproof up to 33 feet (up from 16 feet in the previous model) and supports hands-free gesture control.

 Insta360 GO 3 also uses a new wide-angle lens that should produce less image distortion than its forebear (so, less of fisheye-like bulging effect). Plus, it's Dolby Vision-ready and provides slow-mo recording at up to 200 FPS.

 While I'm impressed by what the Insta360 GO 3s has to offer, I'm disappointed by a few things, too. Insta360 hasn't announced any improvements to the camera's image stabilization, for one, and the camera itself is still too expensive. Customers who want the Action Pod touchscreen mount (an essential accessory, in my opinion) need to shell out at least $400 for the [64GB Insta360 GO 3S bundle](https://www.amazon.com/Insta360-Summit-White-64GB-Multifunctional/dp/B0D4GFTB5L?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003632&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Finsta360-launches-go-3s-4k%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term). The bundle comes with some extra mounts and accessories, but it's a far bigger investment than it should be.

 If you can live without the Action Pod, you can buy the [standalone Insta360 GO 3S](https://www.insta360.com/product/insta360-go3s) for $240\. Upgrading to the 128GB variant brings the price to $270\. Note that the Insta360 GO 3S is compatible with its predecessor's Action Podâ€”if you bought the previous model, this isn't too painful of an upgrade.
