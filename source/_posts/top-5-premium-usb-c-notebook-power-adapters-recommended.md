## Satechi 100W

### Best USB-C laptop charger overall

**Tech Specs:** **Max output:** 100W | **Ports:** 1x USB-C

This is the perfect replacement for your existing USB-C laptop charger, even if you have something like the latest 16-inch [MacBook Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/16-inch-m1-pro-macbook-pro-the-good-the-bad-and-the-very-very-ugly/).

The next-gen Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology not only means that this charger is smaller than chargers based on older silicon technology (it's smaller than the Apple charger), but it also runs cooler.

This is my go-to charger for pretty much everything I have that uses USB-C.

## How did we choose these USB-C laptop chargers?

Everything on this list hasn't just been tested by me -- every device is part of my daily kit. I personally know that this equipment delivers on what it promises, and it offers a high degree of reliability and robustness. You're getting exceptional value for the money.

I pick manufacturers that offer a decent, no-quibble warranty. Things can (and often do) go wrong, so dealing with a company that has you covered can offer peace of mind.

## Are all USB-C laptop chargers the same?

No. You need to check what power your [laptop](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/) will draw. Some laptops are happy with a 45W charger, while others need a 95W charger. In an emergency, you can still normally trickle charge a laptop using a low-power charger, but that's far from ideal.

Then there's a quality issue. You've likely spent big bucks on a laptop, so it doesn't make sense to connect that up to a cheap charger that you picked up from a dollar store!

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Should I only use the charger that came with my laptop?

The charger that came with your laptop will be designed to work well with your device, but as long as you pick the right charger for your hardware, there's no reason you can't use a third-party charger.

Most manufacturers take the guesswork out of this for you. They'll include device compatibility on the packaging and the website. 

## Should I go for a single-port or multi-port charger?

I prefer the convenience of a multi-port charger, but be aware that most will charge at lower power when more than one port is in use.

## Can I use a USB-C phone charger with my laptop?

You can use a USB-C phone charger with your laptop, but since both types of devices have different power requirements, it may take longer to get your computer up to a full charge.

## What is the difference between USB and USB-C?

A USB-C charger can support up to 100 watts and 20 volts of power, while a traditional USB charger can only support 2.5W and 5V. This means that not only will a USB-C charger top up your devices faster, but it can also be used with multiple devices at once, as well as for larger devices like laptops.

## Are there alternative USB-C laptop chargers worth considering?

Our best USB-C chargers include a mix of products where you can maximize your productivity by charging multiple devices at once, save money, and have charging capabilities in your vehicle. If you need further options, here are a few to consider:
