## Now Accessible: The Latest Smart LED Containers by Nanoleaf Hit the Market.

Nanoleaf’s Expo Smart LED Display Cases showcase your sneakers, rare figurines, or any prized collection for that matter with animated lighting that syncs across hundreds of cases.

 Nanoleaf has introduced the new EXPO Smart LED Display Cases. Individually, they cost $80 a pop, but you can get them in packs to save some money. The cases are designed strictly for indoor use but think twice about creating an impressively illuminated wall showcase, as these things can add up quickly. You can stack up to sixteen cases atop each other and as many as you like horizontally, for a total of 300 cases at once. Quickly, do the math in your head! Answer: a whopping $22,500 for such a set.

 The inside of each case is 38cm wide, 29cm deep, and 22cm tall and fits shoe sizes up to 15 (US), 14 (UK), and 50 (EUR). A single case produces 50 lumens of light output, with 1200K-6500K color temperature. Nanoleaf says you can drive up to eight cases with a shared 42W power supply or sixteen of them using a 75W power source. The EXPO Cases are compatible with Apple HomeKit, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Razer Chroma so that you can use them along with your other smart home appliances in custom scenes for automation. The cases support the Thread standard and can double as a Thread border router.

 However, you must use the official Nanoleaf app to arrange them in custom patterns. The app automatically detects the location of each case within the pattern, letting you manage any one case easily. With physical controls built into each case, you can adjust light intensity, turn the LEDs on or off, cycle through animations, and more without firing up the app.

 Nanoleaf makes some of the best smart lights, and the EXPO Smart LED Display Cases are no exception with their tunable whites and more than 16 million colors. There are thousands of preset animations, and you can create your own in the app. It gets even better with the built-in rhythm music visualizer syncing your whole smart display case configuration to the beat of your favorite song. Even better, have them act as [bias lighting](https://article-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-winning-strategies-elevating-win11-zoom-experience/), matching the colors of your TV to create an experience akin to a Philips Ambilight TV.
