## Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini Hyperspeed

### Best 65 percent mechanical keyboard

**Razer BlackWidow V3 Mini Hyperspeed tech specs: Type:** Compact | **Wired/wireless:** Wireless | **Number of keys:** 68 | **Dimensions:** 5.14 x 1.61 x 12.55 inches

## How did I choose these best mechanical keyboards?

When comparing the best mechanical keyboards and talking to users, I took several factors into consideration.

* **Size**: There are several different keyboard sizes from which you can choose.
   * A full-size keyboard, or 100% keyboard, is your standard keyboard that includes not only your typical function, arrow, and navigation keys but also a full number pad for easy numerical entry. There are typically 104 keys.
   * A tenkeyless keyboard is your standard 80% keyboard that includes most keys but skips the number pad. It usually includes 87 keys.
   * A compact keyboard, or 60% keyboard, is a more condensed version that does not include a number pad or navigational keys.
* **Clicks**: Keyboards are often rated to last a certain number of clicks. For example, Cooler Master CK552 is rated for 50 million clicks, while the Razer Pro Type Ultra is rated for over 80 million clicks.
* **Switch** **type**: There are three main types of mechanical switches that are commonly seen in mechanical keyboards: linear, tactile, and clicky. Linear switches offer a smoother feel with no resistance, while you can actually feel the bump on tactile switches. As the name suggests, clicky switches have an audible noise when you push them.
* **Backlighting**: The best mechanical keyboards also incorporate backlighting as an added feature. Some keyboards even allow you to customize the lighting for each individual key, creating custom color coding based on your specific tasks.
* **Design**: In addition to the number of clicks, there is the actual design to consider. Look for heavy-duty materials that promise durability, especially if you plan on traveling with them. For example, the Cooler Master CK552 boasts a brushed aluminum design that is far tougher than your standard plastic construction.

## What is the best mechanical keyboard manufacturer?

Many different companies manufacture mechanical keyboards but not all of them may offer the best quality or features to do the job. In my search, I found that the best mechanical keyboards come from companies like Razer, NuPhy, and SteelSeries, but you are likely to find many others in your search.

## Is a mechanical keyboard worth it?

Experts and users agree -- a mechanical keyboard can be a fantastic addition to your setup, especially if you want a great "feel" for typing and gaming. They're also a great option if you want fast button press-to-screen response, custom key-stroke capabilities, durability, and long-lasting battery. 

## How much do mechanical keyboards cost?

It is possible to spend less than $100 when searching for the best mechanical keyboard, but it all depends on what you are looking for in a keyboard. The best mechanical keyboards range in cost from $80 to nearly $200, depending on factors like the keyboard size and manufacturer that you choose. 

## Which key switch is right for you?

This can be decided based on a combination of what your most common use case for a keyboard is, as well as your personal preference for typing feel. I'll explain each of the three main switch types, and who they're generally considered best for, briefly. 

| **Clicky switches**  | Typically blue, these switches make an audible click when they reach their actuation point. They were initially the most popular switches among many manufacturers, but fell out of favor due to some users finding their incessant clicking an annoyance to themselves or their house/office mates. Still, some prefer the rhythmic sounds of typing or the audible assurance these provide. They're equally well-suited to gamers or practical typists.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tactile switches** | Typically brown, these keep the tactile sensation of the clicky switches above, but purposely dampen the noise. That said, they're still louder than the linear switches below. Some prefer the surety of the tactile "bump" denoting the actuation point, while others find the sudden increase in keypress resistance jarring and disruptive. Many practical typists prefer tactile switches as the "bump" can sometimes prevent accidental keypresses, reducing typos. While some gamers do enjoy the surety of feeling the actuation point, others don't appreciate the slow-down that tactile bump adds to their keypresses. That extra moment of key travel can often be the split-second difference between in-game life and death. |
| **Linear switches**  | Typically red, these switches are pure up-and-down. There's no audible or physical indication of their actuation point, providing the smoothest operating experience of any switch here. This smoothness and speed has made linear switches the go-to choice for many gamers interested in reducing their reaction times to the bare minimum. For that same reason, some serious typists avoid linear switches due to their tendency to introduce unintended errors thanks to their generally lighter weight and unrestricted travel.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

It's worth noting that all of the above statements apply most aptly to the standard clicky, tactile, and linear switches that ship with most boards. These switch designs and their semi-standard color-coding are all based on designs originated by German switch maker Cherry. It still creates versions of all three, as well as far more exotic variants. Many other manufacturers also create countless variants with higher actuation points, heavier or lighter springs, unusual case and stem materials, and more. 

Ideally, if you're ever considering a new switch, try to buy one, or just a few, to test the feel before you commit to enough for a full board. The same goes for any pre-made boards with pre-installed switches you can try before you buy as well.

## Is wireless connectivity OK for gaming?

This is a more nuanced subject than it might seem at first. Wireless keyboards that rely on Bluetooth (as well as other peripherals that rely on it) can suffer from latency. This means any command entered on them will be delayed, usually by about 0.2 seconds or less. Wired keyboards don't suffer from this delay, meaning that commands are registered almost instantly. 

In an ideal world, any keypress during a game will be instantly recognized to give the player the minimal amount of delay before that life-saving jump or vital crouch is registered. While Bluetooth might get you close enough to instant for more casual games, I wouldn't recommend it for competitive shooter games and high-pressure MMORPGs. Thankfully, many wireless keyboards also offer a wired mode for just this reason. 

The only exception I'd make for using a wireless gaming keyboard is if the board in question used 2.4GHz wireless, like some options from Logitech. These dongle-based wireless connections offer far lower latency, and can be just as ideal for gaming as high-end wireless mice have become.

## What parts of a mechanical keyboard can you modify?

Short answer: all of them. 

Longer answer: the most common would be the key switches and keycaps. Both of these can completely change the feel of a board and, if you have hot swap sockets in your board, both can be swapped out with no more difficulty than unplugging a USB cable and plugging in a new one. 

More exotic mods can include things like replacing the stabilizers that help keep longer keys (space, shift, enter, etc.) level while traveling, as well as adding sound-dampening foam or silicone. Just about every moving part can also be lubricated to make it feel smoother and dampen its sound a bit. The possibilities are nearly endless when you start to get into all of the available switches, caps, case options, and unique parts being created for mechanical keyboard modding today.
