## Unlock Exclusive Discounts on Gadgets: Anker's Mini Power Bank, Latest Google Pixel Timepiece, and Secure Your Home with Blink Cameras!

It's the biggest shopping event of the year that isn't named Black Friday. Today is the last day to take advantage of Amazon's big Prime Day deals, and we found huge discounts on Pixel phones and watches, PC accessories, smart home goods, and so much more.

 While [Prime Day deals](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-still-using-pattern-locks-with-xiaomi-redmi-12-5g-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/) technically only run on July 16-17th, expect lower prices throughout the rest of the week and into the weekend. Below, we've gathered some favorites, including the extremely popular Anker Nano phone charger, Bose headphones, QLED TVs, portable speakers, smart fingerprint-equipped door locks, and other home goods.
