## Discover the Ultimate Black Friday & Holiday Promotions at Newegg  Exclusive List

While Black Friday and Cyber Monday have come and gone, Newegg is still offering discounts on tech across the site, like desktops, laptops, and PC components. You can even find great deals on PC and console games. And if you purchase something from Newegg, it will be backed by their Black Friday price guarantee. This policy ensures that you're getting the lowest possible price before Black Friday, and if it ever drops below what you spent, Newegg will automatically refund you the difference.

## When is Black Friday 2023?

In the United States, the popular shopping day known as Black Friday takes place the day after Thanksgiving. This year, Black Friday will be November 24\. And if you aren't able to keep an eye on digital sales events or make it to a store in person: many retailers like [Amazon](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/the-best-early-black-friday-2023-amazon-deals/), [Best Buy](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/the-best-early-best-buy-black-friday-2023-deals/), and Walmart extend sales and deals events through the weekend and into the Monday or even Tuesday after Thanksgiving. This is typically known as the Cyber 5 event, with each day having a loose theme for sales purposes: Black Friday, Small Business Saturday (for shopping at local stores), Cyber Sunday/Monday (focusing on internet retailers like Amazon), and Giving Tuesday (focusing on charitable donations). 

Newegg is running their Black Friday sales event through November 25th, backed by their Black Friday price guarantee to automatically refund you the difference if the price drops on what you bought before the 25th.

## How did we choose these early Black Friday deals?

ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops. 

We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.

## What is the best gaming PC?

 My choice for the [best gaming PC](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-gaming-pc/) is the Alienware Aurora R15 for its liquid cooling system, dual storage drives, and range of configuration options. You can create your own build with either an Intel or AMD-based chipset, and with up to an RTX 4080 graphics card for all the power you need to play the latest triple-A PC games.
