Uber

If you've decided to [go green](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/sustainability/tech-for-a-sustainable-future-the-challenges-and-opportunities-ahead/), Uber is now letting you see just how much of a positive impact on the environment you've had.

The company today introduced an Emission Savings feature. When you open Uber's app and visit the account page, you can now see the carbon emissions you've saved by taking Uber Green or Uber Comfort Electric.

The information is calculated, [Uber](https://www.zdnet.com/article/uber-is-working-on-its-own-ai-project-reveals-ceo/) says, based on the amount of Uber Green and Uber Comfort Electric rides you've taken, and the amount of [CO2 emissions](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/how-much-co2-are-your-zoom-meetings-generating/) avoided compared to UberX or Uber Comfort trips of the same distance.

Your savings are shown in total kilograms. If that insight is insufficient, you can see a graphic that breaks down your savings in terms you can more easily understand, such as total gallons of gas saved or total miles driven in a non-gas-powered car.

The savings are shown for regular Uber accounts as well as Uber teen accounts.

The company plans to add more types of rides to its emissions savings calculator, including using autonomous or driverless electric vehicles or [e-bikes](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-electric-bike/) and [e-scooters](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-electric-scooter/) booked through Uber or UberX Share trips.

Uber is taking steps to ensure the savings shown are as accurate as possible. The average emission intensity of a ride changes over time and varies by city, so your total will be based on each ride option in your city. The results for current users won't start at zero. Total emissions calculated, the company says, will be based on rides taken since the beginning of 2021\. 

"We're on a mission to make it effortless for our riders to embrace a low-emissions lifestyle," Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said. "Just like we popularized rider ratings in an effort to promote respectful behavior during Uber rides, we're excited to launch the Emission Savings feature to both celebrate your impact and encourage greener choices when using Uber."
