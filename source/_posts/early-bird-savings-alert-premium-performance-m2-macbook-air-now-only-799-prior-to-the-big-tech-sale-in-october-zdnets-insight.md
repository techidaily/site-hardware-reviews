The Zenbook Duo challenged what a laptop could look like with its dual-screen form factor, and then committed to its design by making both displays 3K OLEDs with silky-smooth 120Hz refresh rates. Creators will gravitate to these gorgeous displays, but the powerful hardware on board (Intel Core Ultra 9 processor and 32GB of RAM) seals the deal as a performant machine for outside-the-box thinkers.

### Are laptops really cheaper on Prime Day?

Amazon hasn't historically been the premiere destination for laptop deals, but the ones it lists for Prime Day have been too good to ignore. The MacBook deals, for example, were pretty major when they first dropped, since Apple is notorious for being restrictive about sales. The deals on Prime Day have gotten better each year, with more and more manufacturers participating with a broader range of devices.

### How did we choose these October Prime Day deals?

We searched for laptop deals on Amazon that are significant markdowns from their regular prices, and on products that we have either gone hands-on ourselves or can vouch for as solid laptops worth consideration. We also used various price trackers to ensure that a claimed deal wasn't spurious.

We have concentrated on quality products from leading vendors, as discounts on these laptops are likely to be most sought-after by potential buyers.

When compiling the list of the best deals, we considered the following:

* **Price**: Naturally, the price point of our recommended laptops has to include a worthwhile discount. While some discounts are small in relation to an overall price tag - for example, $30 off a $150 device - and other discounts are in the hundreds of dollars, we wanted to ensure that in any case, it's value for money.
* **Features**: We included a range of laptops with features sure to appeal to you, including different screen sizes, processors, memory options, and storage. Furthermore, these laptops include varying levels of security, parental lock options, and display resolutions.
* **Use cases**: At ZDNET, we also took into account different use cases. You might be in the market for a budget-friendly, basic laptop for a child, for example, or you may need a future-proof laptop suitable for work. Or, it might be a gaming device you're after. So, we have compiled a set of recommendations based on different purposes.
