The 32-inch panel of the Neo G8 is curved to help prevent glare from overhead lighting as well as better color accuracy at different viewing angles. This is crucial when doing color corrections in photos and video files or choosing a palette for graphic design or digital artwork. It's capable of 4K resolution as long as your graphics card also supports UHD output, and it has a 240Hz refresh rate which is perfect for video editing and reviewing projects before rendering and exporting finalized files.

The 1ms response time gives you near-instant reactions to your keystrokes and mouse button inputs, which is crucial for online multiplayer games and competitive tournaments.

This means you can have it connected to both a gaming PC and console like the [PS5](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsony-playstation-5-slim-console-white%2F6566039.p%3FskuId%3D6566039&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), [Nintendo Switch](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FNintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91%2Fdp%2FB07VGRJDFY%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C137bb2c2-750c-4e12-ace1-86d0a3d6fb15%7Cdtp&dtb=1), or [Xbox Series X|S](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Gaming-Console-video-game%2Fdp%2FB08H75RTZ8%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C137bb2c2-750c-4e12-ace1-86d0a3d6fb15%7Cdtp&dtb=1) or a dedicated workstation and separate gaming PC and quickly switch between them as needed.

## When will this deal expire?

Best Buy hasn't indicated any definitive end-dates for the $500 discount on the Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 32-inch curved gaming monitor, but you won't want to wait around to take advantage of the sale. Samsung or Best Buy may only have a certain number of monitors available at this price, which means the discount may end when they have sold a certain amount. And if you prefer brick-and-mortar shopping, physical stores have very limited stock, and may sell out quickly.
