June Wan/ZDNET

In January of this year, Apple released new configurations to its high-capable line of MacBook Pro laptops. Notably, the updated 2023 [14-inch](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F14-inch&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) and [16-inch MacBook Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F16-inch&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) featured [faster, more capable processors](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-debuts-m2-pro-and-m2-max-the-chipsets-powering-this-years-best-macs/), and a slew of speedier connectivity support.

Apple didn't make any updates to its [13-inch MacBook Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-pro%2F13-inch&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), but new Pro laptops may be in the works, [according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-10-22/what-is-apple-doing-in-ai-revamping-siri-search-apple-music-and-other-apps-lo1ffr7p?srnd=undefined). Gurman says that if customers try to order a new MacBook Pro, they'll see that products won't ship until mid-November, which is indicative of low supplies.

Low supplies could mean Apple is working on something, but rumors vary on what this something could be.

[In July](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-16/apple-creates-new-vision-products-group-vpg-for-future-mixed-reality-headsets-lk5g2ee4), Gurman said that Apple could launch its first Mac computers equipped with an [M3 chip](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ahead-of-m3-launch-this-fall-apple-starts-testing-mac-mini-with-new-chip/), the computers being the [iMac](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fimac-24%2F&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [13-inch MacBook Air](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedId=zdnet&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air%2F13-inch-m2&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), and 13-inch MacBook Pro. Clues point to this release, as Gurman says he was told that Apple will hold a Mac-centered event next week.

The iMac hasn't seen an update since April 2021, and the gap in updates is because of cost concerns, Gurman says. But since March, rumors point to Apple revamping the 24-inch iMac, and it could be announced along with other Mac upgrades.

On the flip side, Apple analyst [Ming-Chi Kuo tweeted](https://twitter.com/mingchikuo/status/1700193866178343036?ref%5Fsrc=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1700193866178343036%7Ctwgr%5E73574263f730b667649fb361b4b113092ba5e397%7Ctwcon%5Es1%5Fc10&ref%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.macworld.com%2Farticle%2F2111544%2Fm3-macbook-pro-everything-you-need-to-know.html) in September that Apple won't launch any Macs with the M3 chip this year, as all manufacturing efforts were funneled into [iPhone 15 production](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-iphone-15-models-compared-iphone-15-vs-plus-vs-pro-vs-pro-max/).

Despite the discourse, Gurman is sure that new and improved Macs are on the way. However, a new 14-inch or 16-inch MacBook Pro most likely won't appear until early next year. 

**Review: [Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (M2 Max, 2023): A content creator's dream machine](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-macbook-pro-m2-max-review/)**

But consumers shouldn't expect many changes to the MacBook Pro design, Gurman writes, as he thinks Apple will only upgrade internal components.

If Gurman's predictions are correct, we may hear new Mac announcements on Oct. 30th or Oct. 31\. This is a developing story that ZDNET will cover, so be sure to check back for updates.
