## Discover the Best Long-Lasting Laptop of the Year - Featuring Sleek Portability and Extended Battery Life

![Asus Zenbook S 14](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/4745d9618c8f842ef28c573ae70b6768f75887f2/2024/09/19/f92a6eca-0cc1-4a6f-8882-7504c280be1b/zenbook-s-14-12.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

It's been a big year for advancements in processor technology, and it's only continuing to ramp up. Intel just announced its next generation of high-efficiency, AI-powered chips with the Core Ultra Series 2, and one of the first laptops it's loaded on is the [Asus Zenbook S 14](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=31828&id=423585&clickref=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nb14f4-m00620-asus-zenbook-s-14-ux5406.html). 

Last month, ZDNET's [Cesar Cadenas](https://www.zdnet.com/meet-the-team/cesar-cadenas/) went [hands-on with the Zenbook S 14](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-most-versatile-laptops-ive-tested-also-has-one-of-the-best-displays/) running the Intel Core Ultra 5 processor, praising the laptop's performance, battery efficiency, and brilliant OLED display. The accessible hardware configuration of 8GB of RAM and 512GB of storage kept the price down to an agreeable $800, while the processor's NPU did the heavy lifting. The biggest drawback we noted was its tendency to run hot. More on that in a bit.

Now, a month later, we have yet another configuration of the Zenbook S 14 with the [just-announced](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/processors/core-ultra/core-ultra-series-2-mobile-product-brief.html) Intel Core Ultra 7 200V (Series 2) processor on a 32GB, 1TB loadout. Intel's new chip comes with an enhanced NPU 4.0 AI Engine for 47 TOPs, aiming to bridge the gap with other AI-powered processors with upgraded x86 efficiency and redesigned architecture for powering thinner, lighter devices (that endeavor to run cooler). 

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Preorder the Asus Zenbook S 14 Fast, thin, and with a gorgeous display, the Zenbook S 14 with Intel's new Core Ultra 7 Series 2 processor brings a new level of performance to Asus' most popular line of laptops. View at Asus](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=31828&id=423585&clickref=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nb14f4-m00620-asus-zenbook-s-14-ux5406.html)

Asus' Zenbook S 14 was already a thin, battery-efficient machine. This processor aims to improve and expand its performance in ways that consumers care about (and in ways that are under the microscope in the current market). In that context, Intel is taking aim at other AI processors that are powering Windows' line-up of Copilot+ PCs, such as Qualcomm's Snapdragon X series and AMD's Ryzen AI chips.

I went hands-on with the Zenbook S 14 over the course of a week and found this Core Ultra 7 Series 2-powered laptop runs a lot like the aforementioned Snapdragon X- and Ryzen-based machines. It's snappy, with rapid-fire load times and smooth transitions between apps while multi-tasking. Even better is the fact that the laptop's gorgeous OLED display with a variable 120Hz refresh rate feels smooth and premium.

While running the [industry-standard gamut of benchmarking software](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-laptops/) on this machine, I got numbers that correlated with Intel's expected metrics: 

| | **Cinebench 24 MC**                                     | **Geekbench 6.2.2 SC** | **Geekbench 6.2.2 MC** |       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----- |
| Asus Zenbook S 14 with Intel Core Ultra 7 200V (Series 2) | 481                    | 2748                   | 11050 |

In terms of battery life, the Zenbook S 14 is nothing short of impressive. During our livestream test, this laptop lasted well over 17 hours streaming a full-screen video over Wi-Fi. However, during sustained, normal use, I got between eight to ten hours, depending on what I was doing. 

This is where the AI comes into play: The power-saving technology with Intel's "Intelligent Display" and dynamic tuning uses machine learning algorithms to automatically adjust brightness, refresh rate, and contrast based on user activity and on-screen content. This is what allows this device to effortlessly play media for several hours on end with only a trickle of battery life.

Regarding the body, the laptop's ceraluminum construction is matte and slightly rough with a speckled, organic texture. Overall, the Zenbook's design is bold and refreshing, defined by thin bezels and straight, crisp lines. The keyboard has a soft but satisfyingly tactile feel, and the trackpad is functional and well-positioned, going right up to the absolute edge of the device. 

Intel promised thin-and-light form factors with its new processors, and this baby is indeed thin and light. When closed, it's 0.47 inches thick, and weighs only 2.65 pounds. The unique surface is easy to grip and resists fingerprints, and the port selection is refreshingly expansive: You've got two USB-Cs, an HDMI, USB-A, and a headphone jack.

The Intel Arc GPU on board also provides a surprisingly high-performing gaming experience, as well. I streamed a few games I have in the cloud, and Intel's Core Ultra 7 and slick OLED screen make for a solid gaming device, exonerated from the emulation issues that making gaming on a Copilot+ PC a headache.

There is one thing I should mention: the heat dispersion. This isn't the hottest laptop out there, but it's certainly not a cool and unbothered one, either. In my experience, I would say it generates about the same amount of heat as the previous config of the Zenbook S 14 we tested with the Intel Core Ultra 5 (which [we noted](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-most-versatile-laptops-ive-tested-also-has-one-of-the-best-displays/) was on the high side).

Just to put this into perspective, a year ago this would be considered average; it's with the deployment of ARM architecture that the expectation and perceptions surrounding Windows PCs have shifted. Now that we've seen [Windows machines run seemingly fanless](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-13-inch-laptops-ive-tested-has-marathon-battery-life-and-a-bold-design/), there's no going back. This laptop runs hotter than any of the Copilot+ PCs I've tested, yes, but it's also incredibly thin. 

Besides this, the thinness also comes with a few other trade-offs, namely the fact that when the speakers are firing (which, get _loud_, by the way), the whole device vibrates. This may or may not be a dealbreaker for some, but it does have an effect on the user experience, and is an inevitable physical result of working with such a thin form factor.

To sum it all up, there is more than one pathway toward the AI-powered future, and laptop manufacturers like Asus and Lenovo are proving that with devices that come in myriad configurations as technology continues to develop at warp speed. For the consumer, this means options, but also trade-offs.

The Zenbook S 14, for example, is available as:

* A [Copilot+ PC with an AMD Ryzen AI 300 series](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-zenbook-s-16-16-3k-oled-touch-screen-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-365-24gb-memory-1tb-ssd-scandinavian-white%2F6584435.p&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) chip for $1,400
* As [an affordable OLED device with a mid-grade Intel Core Ultra 5](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-zenbook-14-oled-14-wuxga-touch-screen-laptop-intel-core-ultra-5-with-8gb-memory-512gb-ssd-jasper-gray%2F6568759.p&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) for $800
* And now, with [Intel's latest Core Ultra Series 2 processor](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=31828&id=423585&clickref=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nb14f4-m00620-asus-zenbook-s-14-ux5406.html) for $1,500 as the latest in x86 architecture

Intel wants to provide all the benefits of Windows-on-ARM chips but without any of the compatibility or emulation issues, and it succeeds in some respects (battery life, performance, a thin and light form factor), but doesn't quite match up in others (heat dispersion).

Issues aside, the Zenbook S 14 is a boldly designed device, and one of my favorite laptops of 2024 for its commitment to the experience. This is a laptop I enthusiastically recommend for anyone who wants a gorgeous display, high-performing processor, and above all, a bold and ultraportable form factor at a competitive price point. 

The Asus Zenbook S 14 is [available for preorder now](https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=31828&id=423585&clickref=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nb14f4-m00620-asus-zenbook-s-14-ux5406.html), with devices expected to ship September 24, 2024\.
