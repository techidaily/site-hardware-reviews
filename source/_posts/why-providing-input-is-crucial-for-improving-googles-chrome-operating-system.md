## 1\. Magic Editor in Google Photos

By now, you likely know what [Magic Editor](https://www.zdnet.com/article/magic-editor-and-other-ai-features-in-google-photos-are-coming-to-your-phone-for-free/) is and how it can help you create the perfect photo.

## 4\. AI-generated wallpapers and video call backgrounds

With the help of AI, you'll be able to dream up just about any kind of image you want or need to serve as your Chromebook wallpaper or video call backgrounds.

You'll find some pre-built prompts included to help you build your backgrounds of all types (such as fun, whimsical, zen, and professional). Select what you want to see, and Google's AI will take it from there to generate an image specific to your prompt.

## 5\. Quick access to Google Tasks

If you're a fan of Google Tasks, you might be happy to hear that you'll now have one-click access, via a built-in view of Google Tasks that makes it easy to add or check off todos.

**Also: [ChatGPT vs. Microsoft Copilot vs. Gemini: Which is the best AI chatbot?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpt-vs-microsoft-copilot-vs-gemini-which-is-the-best-ai-chatbot/)**

Google Tasks will be accessible from the date icon on the bottom-right of your home screen, and will also be accessible across Google Workspace apps and devices. That means if you've added a task from Gmail on your Android phone, you can pick up where you left off on your Chromebook.

These new features will be available to Chromebook Plus devices on the latest Chrome OS version to be released on (or after - depending on your location) May 28, 2024.
