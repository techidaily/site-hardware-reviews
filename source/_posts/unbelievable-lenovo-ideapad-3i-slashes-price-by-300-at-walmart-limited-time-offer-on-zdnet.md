Lenovo's IdeaPad 3i is the perfect college laptop for students on a budget.

Lenovo/ZDNET

Early October is a great time to buy a new laptop as many models see huge discounts online, and [Lenovo's IdeaPad 3i](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-IdeaPad-3i-15-Intel-Core-i7-1255U-16GB-RAM-512-GB-SSD-Arctic-Grey-Windows-11-Home-82RK017QUS%2F5527026637&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) is one such device. And during [Walmart's Holiday Deals sale](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) that kicks off on Oct. 9 (or 12 p.m. ET on Oct. 8 for Walmart Plus members), you can buy the mid-range laptop for just $479\. That's almost $300 off the original price, making an already inexpensive computer even more affordable.

Lenovo's 15-inch IdeaPad 3i has been a reliable choice since its launch. While it may not be a beast like the [ThinkPad X1 Carbon](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpadx1%2Fthinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-12-14-inch-intel%2Flen101t0083%3F), it still stands out as one of our top picks for students and professionals on a budget, offering solid performance without breaking the bank. 

For starters, it comes equipped with a Full HD touchscreen, allowing users to enjoy all forms of content in high resolution. The display is treated with an anti-glare that ensures clear visibility even in bright environments. Keep in mind the brightness level maxes out at 300 nits, so you may struggle to view the screen when sitting directly under the sun. When indoors, however, the viewing experience should be more than adequate.

Under the hood, the IdeaPad 3i houses a 13th-Gen Intel Core i7-1255U processor, an Iris Xe graphics card, and 16GB of memory. This setup is great for light school and office work, from managing spreadsheets to building presentations to photo editing. Its battery is rated to last up to six hours on a single charge, although, with a few adjustments to the settings, you might be able to squeeze out a few extra hours.

Other notable features include a full-size keyboard for comfortable typing and a pair of 1.5W Dolby Audio speakers, which go well with the 720p camera for video calls. If you're looking for an affordable, well-performing laptop, the once-$700 [Lenovo IdeaPad 3i](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-IdeaPad-3i-15-Intel-Core-i7-1255U-16GB-RAM-512-GB-SSD-Arctic-Grey-Windows-11-Home-82RK017QUS%2F5527026637&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) is one of the best on the market. Just act fast once the sale does go live -- this model doesn't appear to be available for purchase on Lenovo's website, so we don't expect the deal to last.
