Let's face it: You don't always need to carry around a $1,000 laptop on campus. If you're a college student who needs to gear up for the upcoming school year with a laptop that doesn't cost an arm and a leg, it doesn't get much more affordable than [Acer's Aspire Go 15 (2023)](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAspire-i3-N305-Graphics-Windows-AG15-31P-3947%2Fdp%2FB0CV5ZSR17%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C0f14c903-3747-4a2d-8cbb-6d311bd0fc40%7Cdtp&dtb=1) for just $299.

Last year's version of the Aspire Go 15 is almost identical to this year's, featuring a modest set of hardware that's well-optimized to cover the basics like web browsing, emailing, writing papers, and research. The 15-inch display is in that middle ground when it comes to laptops: not too small, but not too big; it's easy to carry around.

The [Acer Aspire Go 15 (2023)](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAspire-i3-N305-Graphics-Windows-AG15-31P-3947%2Fdp%2FB0CV5ZSR17%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C0f14c903-3747-4a2d-8cbb-6d311bd0fc40%7Cdtp&dtb=1) comes with Windows 11, which future-proofs the machine for years of updates, and it's loaded with all the Microsoft Office apps you'll need for class such as Microsoft Word and Excel. Windows 11 also comes with the new and improved Windows Copilot, giving you full access to cutting-edge AI technology with the integrated Copilot button on the keyboard. 

In terms of hardware, the Acer delivers 128GB of storage with 8GB of RAM and an Intel Core i3 processor. When it comes to handling the basics for your classes, the 15-inch screen offers plenty of real estate for spreadsheets and documents.

For ports and connectivity, all your bases are covered with two USB-A ports, an HDMI port, a headphone jack, and a USB-C port. There's also a Kensington Lock slot in case you want to lock your device up for extra security while on campus. 

Of course, we have to talk about battery life. The Acer Aspire Go series has a well-optimized battery since the hardware on board doesn't require a ton of extra power. The proprietary charger it comes with uses a DC-in jack, but you can also charge it via the USB-C port, offering an added degree of flexibility based on what's available.
