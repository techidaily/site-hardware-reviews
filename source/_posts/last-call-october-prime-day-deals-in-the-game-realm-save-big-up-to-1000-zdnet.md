### Are games, consoles, and accessories really cheaper on Prime Day?

Games, consoles, and accessories can and do go on sale during Prime Day, though not every brand or manufacturer may participate. Some brands may have competing sales at other retailers or on their own direct-sale sites, which is great news for anyone who likes to compare discounts to make sure they're getting the best deal possible.
