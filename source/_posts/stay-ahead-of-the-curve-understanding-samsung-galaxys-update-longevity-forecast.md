### Key Takeaways

* Samsung promises at least four years of Android OS updates and five years of security releases for most Galaxy phones.
* The Galaxy S24 series will receive seven years of major Android OS updates, matching Google's efforts for new Pixel phones.
* Older Galaxy devices, such as the Galaxy S10 and Note 10, only received three years of major Android updates and should be replaced for continued support.

 Whether you just ordered a shiny new Galaxy S24 or have an older Samsung Galaxy phone, it'll eventually stop getting software updates. So, how long will your Samsung Galaxy be supported with major Android OS releases? That's a complicated question.

 As many of you know, most Android phones don't get updates for as long as an iPhone. However, Samsung and [Google are working hard](http://blog.google/products/pixel/software-support-pixel-8-pixel-8-pro/) to change that narrative. If you're wondering [how long your Android will get updates](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/how-to-delete-icloud-account-with-or-without-password-from-your-iphone-se-2022windowsmac-by-drfone-ios/), it unfortunately varies by manufacturer and model. Thankfully, Samsung Galaxy Phones are starting to last much longer, and here's what to know about your phone.

##  Samsung's Software Update Promise

 In 2021, [Samsung announced](https://fake-location.techidaily.com/how-to-fake-gps-on-motorola-edgeplus-2023-for-mobile-legends-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) that all new phones made after 2019 would see at least three major updates and four years of security releases. That's why your old Galaxy S10 is [no longer getting updates](https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-spy-on-text-messages-from-computer-and-vivo-y100-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/).

 Then, in 2023, the company [extended that pledge to five years](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-a-non-responsive-iphone-display-a-step-by-step-guide/) for most phones, [including foldables](https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/tackling-the-chatgpt-bodystream-error-top-7-strategies-for-a-seamless-fix/). That's four years of Android releases and five years of security updates. This isn't just for flagship models but for many mid-range phones, budget Galaxy A devices, tablets, and more. Thankfully, Samsung shared an [exhaustive list of device security support](https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb) where you can look up your exact model.

##  Galaxy Devices Getting Seven Years of Android Updates

* Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24 Plus, Galaxy S24 Ultra

 With the [new Galaxy S24 series launch](https://video-content-creator.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-android-video-editors-for-chromebook-top-recommendations/), Samsung is now promising seven years of major Android OS updates, which matches Google's efforts for new Pixel phones. That's a big deal, and it means anyone who buys the Galaxy S24 (running Android 14) will get major Android OS updates and security releases until 2031, potentially Android 21 or whatever it'll be called at that time.

 Expect high-end devices like the Galaxy Z Flip 6 and other future flagships to get similar treatment.

 As we mentioned earlier, most Galaxy phones and tablets released throughout the last several years will be eligible for four years of Android OS updates from the date they're released, along with another year or so for security patches after that. Here are some notable models.

* Galaxy S21, Galaxy S21 Plus, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 FE
* Galaxy S22, Galaxy S22 Plus, Galaxy S22 Ultra
* Galaxy S23, Galaxy S23 Plus, Galaxy S23 Ultra, Galaxy S23 FE
* Galaxy A24, Galaxy A33, Galaxy A34, Galaxy A53, Galaxy A54, Galaxy A55, Galaxy A73,
* Galaxy F54 5G, Galaxy Z Flip 3, Galaxy Z Flip 4, Galaxy Z Flip 5
* Galaxy Z Fold 3, Galaxy Z Fold 4, Galaxy Z Fold 5
* Galaxy Tab S8, Galaxy Tab S8 Plus, Galaxy Tab S8 Ultra
* Galaxy Tab S9, Galaxy Tab S9 Plus, Galaxy Tab S9 Ultra (along with S9 FE models)
* and more

 While we're mainly focusing on phones and tablets here, the Galaxy Watch 4, Galaxy Watch 5, and Galaxy Watch 6 series should receive the same four-year update life cycle.

##  Older Galaxy Devices Getting Three Years of Android Updates

 Sadly, most phones older than the Galaxy S21 series (like the Note 20, Galaxy A32, etc.) were released when Samsung only offered three years of major Android updates. As a result, you should consider [replacing old devices like the Galaxy Note 10](https://data-safeguard.techidaily.com/advanced-web-tracking-made-easy-the-cookiebot-difference-explained/), as they'll no longer be getting updates.

* Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10e, Galaxy S10 Plus, Galaxy S10 Lite
* Galaxy Note 10 Lite, Galaxy Note 10 4G/5G, Galaxy Note 10 Plus
* Galaxy S20, Galaxy S20 FE, Galaxy S20 Plus, Galaxy S20 Ultra
* Galaxy Note 20, Galaxy Note 20 Ultra
* Galaxy Z Fold, Galaxy Z Flip, Galaxy Z Flip 2, Galaxy Z Fold 2
* Galaxy A51, Galaxy A52, Galaxy A71, Galaxy A72, Galaxy A90
* Galaxy Tab S6, Galaxy Tab S6 Lite
* Galaxy Tab S7, Galaxy Tab S7 FE, Galaxy Tab S7, Galaxy Tab S7 Plus
* and more

 It's worth noting that while newer Galaxy A models like the 2023 [Galaxy A54 5G will get five years of OS updates](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/troubleshooting-a-non-responsive-iphone-display-a-step-by-step-guide/), we're not sure if all future A-series releases will get the same treatment.

 Either way, Samsung is clearly working hard to update as many phones as possible to deliver longer lifespans. That goes for Android OS updates and monthly, quarterly, or bi-annual security patches. In closing, remember that these update paths are subject to change at Samsung's discretion, and some timelines will differ depending on the region and model.
