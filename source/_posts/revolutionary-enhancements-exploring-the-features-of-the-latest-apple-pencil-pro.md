## Revolutionary Enhancements: Exploring the Features of the Latest Apple Pencil Pro

Apple has sought to improve the iPad for two different use-cases: a sort of Mac replacement with a number of computer-like improvements, but it also hasn't forgotten about the tablet aspect. The Apple Pencil is probably one of the best tools for iPad owners, especially for artists. The accessory hasn't been updated since 2018, but now, Apple has released a new, revamped model coinciding with its new range of tablets.

 Apple has just announced the new Apple Pencil Pro, the latest addition to the company's range of styluses. The announcement was made at the company's latest hardware event, where it also announced the new [iPad Air](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/optimizing-fallout-4-performance-for-lightning-fast-loads/) as well as the new [M4-powered iPad Pro](https://some-guidance.techidaily.com/new-transform-your-note-habits-with-mematics-tools/). It's been six years since the last new model was released, so as you might expect, there's a lot of changes to see here. We did get a new Apple Pencil last year but it was just the first-gen model with the Lightning port swapped out for a USB-C port.

 For starters, the new Pro model includes haptic feedback, which lets you feel a subtle vibration effect when performing certain actions. We also have a new sensor in the barrel of the sensor, which lets you do certain squeeze and double-tap actions such as pulling up menus and activating shortcuts, as well as a gyroscope that detects whenever you rotate the Pencil, letting you "barrel roll" and rotate brushes and do other actions within apps. The result is what's probably the most intuitive Apple Pencil to date. You'll be able to take advantage of the new Pencil features within ProCreate, and they should land on other apps as well over the coming months.

Apple

 The Apple Pencil has been a confusing product lineup in the past. Not only has Apple not really cared to update the Apple Pencil lineup for a few years now, but the few devices that are available on the market are weird and confusing. The Apple Pencil 2 is not compatible with all models of the iPad, and it's the case even for newer models of the iPad. The 10th generation iPad, first released in 2022, is only compatible with the first-gen Apple Pencil, despite the fact that the Apple Pencil 2 was released all the way back in 2018 and the first-gen Apple Pencil came out in 2015, a whopping seven years before. This new model is not really solving things a lot in that regard—the Pencil Pro is supported on both the new iPad Pro and the new iPad Air—but it certainly shows that Apple cares about the Pencil.

 The new Apple Pencil is now available for purchase, costing just $129—what was previously the price of the older Apple Pencil. It will be a great addition to the newly-announced iPad models. [It's now available for purchase](https://www.apple.com/us/shop/goto/product/MX2D3) on the [Apple Store](https://www.apple.com/apple-pencil/), and it should reach your doorstep by next week.
