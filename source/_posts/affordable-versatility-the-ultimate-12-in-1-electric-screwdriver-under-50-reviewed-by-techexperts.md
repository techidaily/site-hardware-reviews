* This electric screwdriver has a fast 220 RPM motor, two buttons for screwing in and out for ease of use, three torque settings for different tasks, a circular LED shadowless lamp for better visibility, and includes 12 S2 tool steel bits.

I use a lot of screwdrivers, and I've found that while it's hard to beat a decent set of traditional screwdrivers (here is [a great set by Klein Tools](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKlein-Tools-85148-Screwdriver-Demagnetizer%2Fdp%2FB07W7VCQK3%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1c397782-8666-4103-a15d-044478906f88%7Cdtp&dtb=1) that will last you a lifetime), there are times when electric screwdrivers can take the strain off my hands and wrists.

## Hoto electric screwdriver tech specs

* Rotary knob switches the screwdriver between three different torque settings

* The screwdriver features a circular LED shadowless lamp, so you can see what you're doing
* The Hoto cordless screwdriver set contains a dozen two-inch long S2 tool steel long bits with hardness up to 60HRC
* The screwdriver and bits are stored in the anodized aluminum alloy storage box that has a soft, rubber top handle
* The Universal Type-C charging interface means you don't need a separate charger

**Also: [The best electric screwdrivers: Expert tested](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/best-electric-screwdriver/)**

On the one end of this superb screwdriver is a standard 1/4-inch socket that takes the various bits, and behind that is a rotary knob that switches the screwdriver off and on and also switches between three torque settings. There's also a circular LED shadowless lamp, so you can see what you're doing, which is a nice touch because it means I don't have to wrangle a flashlight [when I'm working](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/this-60-tool-essentially-gives-you-another-pair-of-hands/) in a dark area.

On the other end of the screwdriver, there's a USB-C port for charging the unit -- a neat touch because it eliminates the need for a proprietary charger (I don't need any more of those in my life). 

**Also: [My favorite electric screwdriver for heavy-duty jobs](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/my-favorite-electric-screwdriver-for-heavy-duty-jobs/)**

The controls are about as simple as they get and are located in the middle of the tool. There's a button to screw a screw in and a button to screw a screw out.

The screwdriver and bits are stored in the anodized aluminum alloy storage box that has a soft, rubber top handle. If you want more than the dozen bits, Hoto has a [version with 25 bits in a different case for a few dollars more](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHOTO-Electric-Screwdriver-Cordless-Mechanical-dp-B0BLMQ8BXB%2Fdp%2FB0BLMQ8BXB%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1c397782-8666-4103-a15d-044478906f88%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

This is how you remove the Hoto electric screwdriver from its aluminum carry case.

The three torque settings range from powerful enough to assemble a PC case or flat pack furniture (where you need quite low power) to [powerful enough](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/youll-never-guess-how-many-tech-repair-tools-this-little-bag-can-fit/) to put a fence up or screw down floorboards. 

This screwdriver doesn't offer a super-gentle setting for things such as electronic gadgets, which this screwdriver might be too powerful for. This is where a [mini-precision electric screwdriver](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FElectric-Screwdriver-Precision-Magnetic-Cordless%2Fdp%2FB09N3KQQ5K%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1c397782-8666-4103-a15d-044478906f88%7Cdtp&dtb=1) complements the Hoto screwdriver well (and this is also on sale right now).

### ZDNET's buying advice

Aside from the lack of a super-gentle setting, the [Hoto electric screwdriver with a dozen bits](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHOTO-Screwdriver-Electric-Cordless-Shadowless%2Fdp%2FB08Z74BLX9%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1c397782-8666-4103-a15d-044478906f88%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is a great choice -- especially at this lower price point. Mine has already had well over a year of use now, undertaking tasks such as assembling PC cases, putting together flat-pack furniture, and being abused driving six-inch screws into plastic door and window frames, and it is still going strong. 

It's more than paid for itself!
