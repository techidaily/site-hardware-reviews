## How did we choose these laptop gift ideas?

You may need to balance expectations, budget, and the need for new equipment this year due to the economic situation, but we still need PCs for both work and study -- and they certainly come in handy when it comes to keeping ourselves entertained.

While choosing these products, we tried to include options to suit a range of budgets while also keeping age ranges and their intended use in mind.

## What laptop should I buy?

When you are searching for a new laptop, the first thing you should ask yourself is what its main purpose will be. 

If you intend to use your laptop for work and at home, for example, you will probably want a model with at least a 15.6-inch display. However, if you will be traveling with your new device, you might prefer a more lightweight and easily portable 13.3-inch laptop. 

Gamers might opt for a larger screen still and higher resolutions, whereas with daily tasks such as email and study -- with the occasion video call or social media check -- you can easily get away with mid-range specs, such as 8GB/16GB RAM. 

Unless you are a Linux fan, you then need to decide what operating system you are the most comfortable with. The most common options are either Microsoft Windows or Apple macOS. 

## What is the best laptop for students?

If you plan to make use of the holiday sales to pick up a laptop suitable for a student in the family, or for a friend, it's helpful to know what kind of class or degree they are undertaking. 

You tend to see many Apple MacBook Airs and Pros around campus, and the majority of courses won't require a laptop that must run high-powered, specific software packages. 

However, if the course is creative, things can become a little more complicated, as you will probably want to focus on a screen of at minimum 15.6-inch, at least 16GB RAM, and a high-quality graphics card. 

## Does laptop storage matter?

The amount of storage on offer when you buy a laptop varies. Typically, you can expect storage to range between 128GB and 1/2TB solid-state drive (SSD) storage, although when it comes to Chromebooks, the smaller form facts mean that embedded MultiMediaCard (eMMC) storage is used, reducing capacity drastically.

1TB is usually adequate for apps, software, games, and music. However, in any case, you can purchase portable hard drives to boost your storage space -- and create backups of your valuable data.
