## How did we choose these Best Buy tech gift ideas?

I did my best to include a variety of gadgets, devices, and even toys on this list to suit different interests as well as budgets. I purposely excluded gaming items in favor of wearables, drones, and other high-tech items, but if you've got a gamer to shop for, you can check out our [gaming gift guide](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/gaming-gift-guide/).

## What makes a good tech gift?

The most important question you have to ask yourself when shopping for tech-centric gifts for others is this: Is this practical and useful? It's tempting to snap up the latest fad gadget in order to stay abreast of the zeitgeist, but they're often shoddily made in order to pump out millions of units for retailers -- plus, they're often gimmicky or single-purpose. 

If you want to buy a tech-centric gift, make sure it's going to streamline something in the receiver's life or integrate into and enhance their existing arsenal of devices and gadgets. A fitness band or smart watch not only lets you keep an eye on your overall health, but it's also great for kids, older parents, and disabled folks to stay in touch without needing to be tethered to a phone all day. Whereas the smart olive pitter is probably going to end up in a thrift store shortly after the holidays.

## Are VR headsets worth it?

If you aren't an avid gamer, a VR headset isn't going to be a great investment since the technology isn't widely supported by other areas. However, even if you are a gamer, a VR headset is a pretty big investment, often costing hundreds or even thousands of dollars, not to mention how much you have to spend on PC components or a pre-built desktop or laptop in order to even use it. 

But if your budget can handle something like the HTC Vive or Meta Quest 2, they're great additions to your gaming space for more immersive experiences either on your own or with friends.

## What do you get a kid who likes technology?

While older kids and teens may be more interested in smartphones, tablets, and laptops, you can get younger kids excited about technology and STEM fields with high-tech toys like the Mech-5 coding robot kit from Snap Circuits. They'll be able to build their own robot and create different strings of code to make it do different things like navigate a maze or move other objects around.

You can also get an affordable drone like the DJI FPV or a metal detector like the Winbest Barska Pro 200 to get them interested in flight, photography, and even geology and ecology.
