## Seamlessly Transfer Website Links From Your Android Smartphone to Your PC Running Windows

Windows and Android are both extremely popular. Naturally, many people use both platforms on a daily basis. We'll show you how to send links between your phone and PC with Microsoft's Your Phone app, which is built into Windows 11 and Windows 10.

 There's a lot you can do with Microsoft's Your Phone app if you own an Android device. It can [control the music on your phone](https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-starting-point-for-motion-visual-effects/), [mirror notifications to your PC](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/mpow-bluetooth-driver-installation-and-updates-for-win-10-8-7/), [send texts from your PC](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-fundamentals-of-designing-high-converting-snap-ads/), and more. It's not useless on your phone, though.

 Before we get started, [make sure you have the Your Phone experience set up](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/perfect-integration-plugins-chatgpt-and-vs-code-unite/) on your Windows 11 or 10 PC and your Android device. The Your Phone app will already be installed on your PC, the companion app can be installed from the [Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU207661/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.appmanager).

 With that out of the way, you'll first need to find a link to share. You can use any web browser---such as [Google Chrome](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU207661/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome) or [Microsoft Edge](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU207661/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.emmx). We'll be using Chrome in this example.

![Go to a webpage.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-08_16-02-39.png) 

 Next, find the sharing option. In Chrome, that's under the three-dot menu icon. Some browsers have a share icon in the toolbar.

![Go to the share option in the browser.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-08_16-03-33.png) 

 The share menu will open with all of the available apps. Find "Your Phone Companion" and select it.

![Select "Your Phone Companion."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-08_16-05-20.png) 

 A pop-up with a list of your connected PCs will appear. Select the device you would like to send the link to.

![Select your Windows PC.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-08_16-05-59.png) 

 The link will immediately open in your default browser on your PC. If the PC isn't currently running, you'll see a notification appear when you turn it on.

![Link shared successfully.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/2021-12-08_16-06-50.png) 

 That's all there is to it! This is a quick and simple trick, but it can be faster than [syncing tabs](https://fox-access.techidaily.com/elemental-story-framework-for-2024/) and it's much easier than copy and pasting links or sending emails to yourself.
