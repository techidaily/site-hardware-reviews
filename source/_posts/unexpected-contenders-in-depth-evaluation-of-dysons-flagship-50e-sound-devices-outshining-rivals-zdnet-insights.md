Who says the same company that made your vacuum cleaner and hairdryer can't make your headphones? I'm unsure if anyone has ever said that, but Dyson definitely didn't. 

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Dyson OnTrac The OnTrac headphones offer a unique style, impressive sound, and reliable noise-canceling properties. View at Dyson](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=36310&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fheadphones%2Fontrac%2Fcnc-copper)

That's right -- the company responsible for the AirWrap and high-end air purifiers recently released the [OnTrac](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=36310&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fheadphones%2Fontrac%2Fcnc-copper), a pair of headphones poised to compete with the heavy hitters in the premium headphones market.

The OnTrac headphones succeed Dyson's other, more unorthodox foray into the consumer audio industry. Last year, the company [released a pair of headphones with an air-purifying mouthpiece attached](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dysons-new-air-purifying-noise-cancelling-headphones-have-a-launch-date-and-a-hefty-price-tag/). The Dyson Zone headphones may have been too weird for most people to wear in public, but the OnTrac headphones are the company's attempt to appeal to more consumers with a pair of traditional headphones.

The OnTrac certainly have some quirks that only Dyson could integrate into such a simple product, and I spent a week and a half testing them to see if their novelty was worth the $500 price tag. Keep reading to find out.

Headphone manufacturers know that to make a splash in such a saturated market, they must give us something fresh, and Dyson decided to put all of its innovative eggs in the design basket. The OnTrac's unconventional design is the most compelling thing about them. Their visual elements are as true to Dyson's design concepts as every other Dyson product, so they look _exactly_ how you'd expect them to.

The OnTrac's circular, microfiber ear cups are oversized, the body is aluminum for an elevated look and feel, and a multifunction joystick serves as the command center for track play, pause, and skips.

Dyson says its core design mantra is that every product "should feel like using a piece of engineering, not an appliance." The OnTrac follow this philosophy: their design elements and functionality feel like the sum of engineered parts, not like a pair of headphones.

You can also remove the OnTrac's outer caps and ear cushions for enhanced customization. Dyson offers seven different colors to change how your headphones look, from bright Oyster Pink and muted Prussian Blue to shiny CNC Copper and matte Ceramic Khaki.

**Also: [The best noise-canceling headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-noise-canceling-headphones/)**

Despite their obtrusive look, the OnTrac headphones are very comfortable and breathable. The ear cups' interior is very deep, allowing ample room for your ears. The depth allows for an excellent seal between your ears and the outside world, and the microfiber cushions decrease heat buildup.

You may not expect these headphones to amount to much beyond their looks, but the OnTrac headphones sound phenomenal. They have a warm sound profile, prominent bass response, and impressive instrumental clarity.

When I listened to Justin Timberlake's _Tunnel Vision,_ the instrumentals' intricacies were clear, and the bass had a punch and thump that you could feel deep in your ears. However, if you prefer crystal-clear vocals, these headphones may not be suitable for you.

The OnTrac's noise-canceling properties are equally impressive. When I wore them to my local coffee shop, they heavily muffled the chatter and environmental noise around me. The noise-canceling is on par with headphones like the [Sonos Ace](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonos-ace-review/) and [Sony XM5 over-ear headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sony-wh-1000xm5-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-review/) but not as strong as Apple's AirPods Max or [Bose's QuietComfort Ultra](https://www.zdnet.com/article/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review/).

Dyson's companion app is your hub for OnTrac's software customization. It's where you can find audio modes, EQ settings, and battery information. The MyDyson app also offers sound exposure insights to help you understand your ear health. You can see how loud your headphones and external environment are in decibels and real-time to ensure you're not causing too much damage to your ears.

**Also: [What is EQ and why is it an important factor in improving sound?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-eq-and-why-is-it-an-important-factor-in-improving-sound/)**

I frequently used the MyDyson app because I found OnTrac's controls finicky and counterintuitive. The small joystick is aesthetically pleasing, but sometimes I triggered the wrong command when I fiddled with it. You can tap the outside of the left ear cup to toggle between noise-canceling and transparency modes, but I had to give my head a firm, open-handed smack to activate it.

Dyson's out-of-the-box design choices don't end with the headphones; the carrying case is unique, too. The Slimline case is more like a sleeve for storing headphones, and its level of protection and functionality is as questionable as Apple's headphone "case." 

## ZDNET's buying advice

[Dyson's OnTrac headphones](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=36310&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fheadphones%2Fontrac%2Fcnc-copper) prove that innovation is still possible despite the saturation in the headphones market. 

If you prefer your headphones to act as a fashion statement and a conversation piece, the OnTrac are the most unique-looking cans you can find. However, if functionality is at the top of your headphones checklist, the OnTrac will miss the mark. Should Dyson refine some of the tactile controls, it'll solidify its place as a strong competitor in the consumer audio market. 

If you want premium headphones with intuitive physical controls, great sound, and immense comfort but a simple, nondescript design, consider the [Sonos Ace](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSonos-Ace-Wireless-Headphones-Cancellation%2Fdp%2FB0CYHGTMNH%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce2db42b3-f2d1-472e-8b2d-40368a9cba32%7Cdtp&dtb=1). If you want a cheaper premium option with high functionality and impressive noise-canceling, consider the [Sony WH-1000XM5](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FSony-WH-1000XM5-Headphones-Hands-Free-WH1000XM5%2Fdp%2FB0BXYCS74H%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce2db42b3-f2d1-472e-8b2d-40368a9cba32%7Cdtp&dtb=1).
