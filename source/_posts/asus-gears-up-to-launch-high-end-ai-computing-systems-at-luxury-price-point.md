## Skylake System Construction Showdown: Announcing the Champions of Tom’s Hardware Competition

![](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/CH5uzrxu3ikCjo6pLh7v8G-320-80.jpg)

 _\[Editor's Note: Tom's Hardware worked on this project in cooperation with Intel, dozens of system builders, and some of the component manufacturers who provided the prizes. The entire series, featured in our[in-depth slide show](https://tools.techidaily.com) , was produced editorially and without any other input from the various manufacturers, other than what we asked them for in response to the challenge. Needless to say, the entire ecosystem of players has an incentive to see Skylake highlighted, but this series was not funded by any of the parties, other than the supply of prizes.\]_

 We already[revealed the top three systems](https://tools.techidaily.com) submitted by the industry's top boutique PC builders for our Tom's Hardware Skylake System Builder Sweepstakes, but now it's time to reveal the lucky prize winners.

 We asked our readers to choose their favorite custom PC from a selection of 11 different industry-leading builder submissions. Each system was meticulously critiqued by our community based on price, performance and aesthetic value.

 For helping us choose the top three builders (which received a coveted Tom's Hardware Reader's Choice Award), we threw together 10 prize packages that include an Intel Core i7-6700K processor, an[MSI](https://tools.techidaily.com) Z170A GAMING M5 motherboard, a 16 GB kit of G.Skill DDR4-3000 memory, and a 400 GB Intel 750-series PCIe SSD.

 This enormous prize pool would not have been possible without the generous aid of Intel, MSI and G.Skill, who provided not just one set of awesome Skylake parts, but 10 of them.

Here are the official winners:
