## Ultimate Kiddo Audio Gear Guide : Authorized Selections From PCMag

Headphones aren't just for adults, but you should think twice before handing your kids any pair of headphones. The wrong pair not only provides poor audio but can also cause lasting damage. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that an estimated 5.2 million children between 6 and 19 years old have [suffered hearing loss](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/noise.html#:~:text=An%20estimated%2012.5%25%20of%20children,from%20excessive%20exposure%20to%20noise.) due to loud noise. Noise-induced hearing loss can be caused by a variety of events, including exposure to loud noise over an extended amount of time.

## How did I choose these best kids' headphones?

There are several factors we consider when choosing the best kids' headphones. 

* **Type:** There are both wired and wireless kids' headphones available. If your child plans to use the headphones for an extended amount of time each week, you may want to consider a wired version for a steady stream of power. However, if your child is constantly on the go or travels often, you may want to purchase a pair of wireless headphones that offer greater freedom of movement. Some models offer both wired and wireless capability for even greater flexibility.
* **Fit:** Many of the best kids' headphones have an adjustable headband for a firm fit. Loose headphones not only obstruct proper hearing but also risk damage if they were to fall off. Look at the recommended ages for each pair to ensure the headphones are designed for a proper fit. We also suggest looking for headphones that incorporate cushioned ear cups for superior comfort.
* **Connectivity:** Bluetooth connectivity is another feature often available with kids' headphones, enabling you to wirelessly connect to your kids' headphones to a smart device.
* **Budget:** The cost of kids' headphones can vary from one pair to the next, but it generally isn't difficult to find an affordable pair. The best kids' headphones range in price from about $25 to $140, depending on the set you choose.

## Why are headphones for kids important?

If your children need headphones, it is critical that you find the best kids' headphones to preserve their health because hearing loss is all too common these days. Of common chronic physical conditions, hearing loss is the [third most common](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6605e3.htm?s%5Fcid=mm6605e3%5Fw) and twice as prevalent as cancer. It is also non-reversible. 

"I have been recommending these headphones to parents as they are comfortable, safe and easy to use," explains Mark Joseph, Founder of [Parentalqueries.com](https://parentalqueries.com/). "Kids' headphones are specifically designed with smaller sizes and lower levels of sound to protect their developing hearing. The technology used in such headphones is often more durable, meaning they can withstand the rigors of daily playtime. These headphones also come with simplified controls, making them easier for kids to use."

Kids' headphones also incorporate special features not seen in other models, such as restricted volume levels. Several organizations, including the World Health Organization, [recommend](https://www.verywellfamily.com/are-headphones-safe-for-your-baby-5086113) a maximum volume of 75 decibels for children, so you will find that many kids' headphones do have volume limitations, usually around 85 decibels or so. 

## Does my kid need noise-canceling headphones?

Children have far more sensitive ears than adults, so it is critical that everything possible is done to protect them. That includes noise cancellation. Noise-canceling headphones are a relatively new addition to the market and an invaluable one at that. 

Dr. Sarow explains why: "Noise-canceling headphones are a good choice to help prevent hearing damage. Normally, when there is a lot of background noise, people tend to turn up the volume. Noise-canceling headphones make listening at a safe volume easier without straining to hear over the background noise."

Kosciuk adds another perspective. "They're important because they allow parents to control the type of content their children are exposed to. Parents can limit their child's media exposure and control the type of content they are exposed to while still allowing them to enjoy their favorite shows or listen to music."

## Does your child need a microphone?

There are many reasons why a microphone may be useful to your child. With remote learning so prevalent these days, a microphone allows children to learn from home with ease, sounding almost as if they were there in person. It can also come in handy if your child enjoys gaming.

## Are there alternative best kids' headphones worth considering?

These are far from the only options available today. Check out these other picks for best kids' headphones.
