## Introducing the New Wave of Artificial Intelligence with Dell's Latest XPS Laptops – Combining Aesthetics and Innovation

![Dell XPS 14](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/312c12a1f227f2063f736624368ec85d28065e5e/2024/01/04/d3046b31-48bf-410b-a5c9-9e5c036f1dd7/ru09j7k.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Just ahead of [CES 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/topic/ces-2024/), Dell has revealed it will introduce three new models to its XPS series, with each one home to AI-powered performance and features. The trio consists of the XPS 13, XPS 14, and XPS 16\. Before we get into what makes each model unique, let's go over what features they share.

Every laptop will be powered by an Intel Core Ultra processor. The CPU will house an AI acceleration engine alongside a neural processing unit (NPU). The NPU can be considered a third resource, which is separate from the processor and graphics card that the laptop can access. The NPU will alleviate some of the laptop's workload while helping the battery maintain its longevity. What's more, the models will have ExpressCharge software, allowing users to recharge their computer from zero to 80% in about an hour.

### Special Feature

[Best of CES 2024 ZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.  Read now](https://www.zdnet.com/collection/ces-2024/)

As for AI, the most prominent -- and, arguably, game-changing -- feature is [Windows Copilot](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-adding-more-ai-smarts-to-windows-11-via-copilot-and-dev-home/), an on-device assistant that can answer all of your burning questions, create content, or help run certain commands, among other things. There will even be a special button on the keyboard to launch the assistant quickly.

As for the differences between the devices, everything comes down to the different designs of the XPS laptops. The XPS 13, for example, is the lightest of the bunch, clocking in at a measly 2.6 pounds. Contrasting its featherweight frame, it will house a powerful 3K Plus resolution OLED touchscreen, with options for Full HD Plus and Quad HD Plus resolution screens if you want something a little cheaper. If any of this setup sounds familiar, that's because the approach is similar to 2023's XPS 13 Plus. In fact, the laptops look very similar.

It appears Dell decided not to overhaul the design of the XPS 13 Plus when working on the 2024 model. The main differences between the laptops are the AI enhancements that I mentioned earlier.

**Also: [I traded my MacBook for a Dell XPS 15 for a month, and didn't regret it at all](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-traded-my-macbook-for-a-dell-xps-15-for-a-month-and-didnt-regret-it-at-all/)**

Next up is the XPS 14, which -- as you can probably guess -- is bigger than the XPS 13, as it sports a 14.5-inch display. Size isn't the only thing that sets this laptop apart, as customers can elect to equip the device with a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 graphics card for playing or working on videos. Additionally, the laptop comes with Nvidia Studio, a suite of software tools aimed at creative professionals.

Finally, we have the XPS 16, which is essentially a souped-up version of the XPS 14 -- it has a lot of the same capabilities but scaled up. For instance, you have the option to get an RTX 4070 GPU. The laptop also has the best display of the devices, with the option for a 4K Plus OLED screen.

These three XPS laptops will launch later this year (we're not sure exactly when), with prices starting at $1,300.
