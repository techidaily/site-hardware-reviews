## Top-Rated Touchscreen Notebooks: Comprehensive Reviews & Ratings by Tech Gurus

Thanks to the advent of smartphones, most of us quickly became accustomed to interacting with touchscreens. It was only a matter of time before the tech made its way to laptops. Touchscreen laptops offer an engaging and intuitive way to interact with a computer that no device can emulate. They're outright better than traditional laptops in some cases, offering an unmatched level of flexibility. I have gotten to a point where I will begin touching the display on a non-touchscreen computer, thinking I could interact with it.

## HP Spectre x360

### Best touchscreen laptop overall

Taking the top spot is the HP Spectre x360 from early 2024\. Since the launch of this device, we've tested numerous other touchscreen laptops, but this model still stands far above the rest. It's an excellent choice for tackling work and watching movies as it handles both tasks very well.

The Spectre x360 boasts a 14-inch, 2.8K OLED display capable of outputting images filled with vibrant colors and deep blacks. A set of powerful speakers consists of IMAX-tuned tweeters and a woofer, delivering immersive audio. Who needs a projector and stereo system when you have this laptop?

**Review:** [**HP's new Spectre x360 is already one of my favorite laptops of the year. Here's why**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hps-new-spectre-x360-is-already-one-of-my-favorite-laptops-of-the-year-heres-why/)

Under the hood, the Spectre x360 runs on a Meteor Lake processor and 32GB of RAM. This hardware setup allows the laptop to excel in performance, handling intensive tasks with ease. Battery life is pretty solid, lasting about 10 hours during our initial tests.

The laptop's unique, angular design gives this model a very distinct look; however, the Spectre x360 has a limited selection of ports.

**HP Spectre x360 specs: Processor:** Intel Core Ultra 7 155H | **Display size:** 14 inch 2.8K OLED | **RAM:** 32GB | **Storage:** 2 TB | **Battery life:** 14 hours | **Dimensions:** 12.35 x 8.68 x 0.67 inches

## HP Chromebook Plus x360

### Best touchscreen Chromebook

Chromebooks are a great option for people seeking a budget-friendly laptop. They offer a similar experience to more powerful machines and come in a variety of styles. Currently, the HP Chromebook Plus x360 is the best option out there.

Like the Spectre x360 above, this device is also a convertible laptop. You can push the display back, turning it into a de facto tablet. This second form factor comes in handy when you're editing photographs or drawing. And as it happens, the Chromebook Plus x360 specializes in that type of work. 

**Review:** [**This HP Chromebook made living without Windows easier than I expected**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-hp-chromebook-made-living-without-windows-easier-than-i-expected/)

Chromebook Plus models have access to Google's generative AI features such as Magic Editor on Google Photos and Gemini. What's more, these laptops support Adobe Photoshop. Running AI tech requires powerful hardware. HP has equipped the Chromebook Plus x360 with a 12th-gen Intel Core i3 processor.

It's a CPU that's great for creative tasks as the chip can handle multitasking and tough workloads. As for design, HP's Chromebook Plus x360 sports a sturdy aluminum build and a comfortable keyboard for easy typing.

**HP Chromebook Plus x360 specs: Processor:** 12th-gen Intel Core i3 | **Display size:** 14 inch OLED | **RAM:** 8GB | **Storage:** 256 GB | **Battery life:** 14 hours | **Dimensions:** 12.3 x 8.68 x 0.71 inches

## Lenovo Yoga 7i

### Best touchscreen laptop for college students

College students looking for a new study buddy should check out the Lenovo Yoga 7i. It's well-suited for users who need a reliable device for taking notes, doing research, or streaming a movie between classes. The 16-inch full HD touchscreen is highly responsive and offers good picture quality. However, at 300 nits, the display isn't very bright. You'll have a hard time working on the laptop outside, but it works just fine indoors.

**Review:** [**The 2-in-1 laptop that I recommend for college juggles work and play seamlessly**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-2-in-1-laptop-that-i-recommend-for-college-juggles-work-and-play-seamlessly/)

The Yoga 7i is relatively sturdy, too, with a body made primarily from aluminum. The durable hinges prevent screen wobble, and the rounded edges give the unit a premium feel. That said, Lenovo's machine is a bit heavy, clocking in at 4.6 pounds. It makes up for the heft by offering a wide range of ports including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and a micro-SD slot.

When it comes to performance, users can choose between an Intel Core Ultra 5 or Core i7 processor. Either one is good for schoolwork, but if you had to pick one, we recommend the Intel Core Ultra 5 for that extra bit of power. It comes equipped with an Intel Iris Xe graphic card, which is good for some light gaming.

**Lenovo Yoga 7i specs: Processor:** Intel Ultra 5 125U | **Display size:** 16 inch 2K touchscreen | **RAM:** 16GB | **Storage:** 512 GB | **Battery life:** 14 hours | **Dimensions:** 14.24 x 9.84 x 0.75 inches

### Best budget touchscreen laptop

Buying a touchscreen laptop doesn't need to be an expensive endeavor. For budget-conscious readers, we recommend Dell's 2024 Inspiron 14 2-in-1\. Yes, it's another convertible laptop, but we can't help it -- this one is too good. Instead of Intel hardware, the device instead houses an AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS processor and an integrated AMD Radeon 780M graphics card. 

According to our initial tests, the AMD system can perform at about the same level as an Intel Core Ultra 7 CPU setup. So you could purchase a computer as good as some of the best models on the market, but for less than $800.

**Review:** [**One of the most capable 2-in-1 laptops I've tested is not an HP or Lenovo**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-most-capable-2-in-1-laptops-ive-tested-is-not-an-hp-or-lenovo/)

Pro users will appreciate the lightweight design. It weighs a travel-friendly 3.77 pounds and the aluminum build ensures durability. Other notable features for the Inspiron 14 2-in-1 include a booming audio system, a comfortable keyboard, and a robust cooling system. 

**Dell Inspiron 14 2-in-1 specs: Processor:** AMD Ryzen 7 8840HS | **Display size:** 14 inch FullHD Plus | **RAM:** 16GB | **Storage:** 1 TB | **Battery life:** 14 hours | **Dimensions:** 12.3 x 8.9 x 0.62 inches

## Asus ROG Flow X16

### Best touchscreen laptop for content creators

Rounding out our selections is the Asus ROG Flow X16, a gaming laptop that houses the strongest hardware configuration on this list. The model has a 13th-Gen Intel Core i9-13900H processor, a Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card, and 16GB of RAM. While it has all the required specs for playing video games, we're recommending the device to content creators.

The ROG Flow X16's features make it well-suited for graphic design: The laptop is equipped with a stunning Nebula HDR display -- a Quad HD (2,560- x 1,600-pixel resolution) touchscreen based on mini LED technology. The end result is a picture with a high level of brightness and deep contrast. 

It has a peak brightness setting of up to 1,100 nits, which allows you to enjoy the display under sunny conditions. On top of that, the Flow X16 houses a ton of image-enhancing software such as Dolby Vision, a refresh rate of 240Hz for fast response times, and support for the entire DCI-P3 color gamut.

A laptop housing this type of hardware can turn into a furnace, but Asus equips the model with a cooling system way more robust than the Inspiron 14's. It sports five heatpipes pulling heat away from the hardware, a liquid metal compound to help with cooling, and several fans.

**Asus ROG Flow X16 specs: Processor:** 13th-gen Intel Core i9-139000H| **Display size:** 16 inch Quad HD Plus | **RAM:** 64GB | **Storage:** 1 TB | **Battery life:** 14 hours | **Dimensions:** 13.98 x 9.57 x 0.76 inches

## Factors to consider when choosing a touchscreen laptop

When picking out the best touchscreen laptop, there are multiple factors to consider. For our evaluation, we weighed the following aspects:

* **Processor:** A CPU directly determines how fast a laptop can process and finish tasks. This includes actions like opening apps to run complex workloads. We specifically looked for advanced and multi-core processors capable of handling tough workloads.
* **Battery:** [According to HP](https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/tech-takes/how-to-turn-off-touch-screen), touchscreen laptops "consume more power" than traditional laptops. It's possible to deactivate the touchscreen functionality within the Device Manager to conserve power.It is for this reason why we strongly suggest looking up devices with above-average battery life.
* **Display:** Having a good display is arguably the most important factor when shopping for a touchscreen laptop. Some offer a low-cost Full HD screen while devices best suited for artists come equipped with an OLED panel.
* **Design:** There's more to a laptop's design than just aesthetics although that is a big factor. A computer's form factor directly affects how well it can withstand the rigor of travel. Many models are convertible laptops which are great for when you have to change tasks. Of course, you have the option to buy a traditional clamshell setup.

## How we test laptops

ZDNET receives a lot of laptops to review, and honestly, many of them could've made the list. To separate the best from the rest, we follow the criteria mentioned in the previous question. At first, the laptop is tested casually: surf the internet, watch videos, download apps, and work on them just to get a feel for them. From there, we run more labor-intensive apps and perform benchmark tests to see what the hardware is capable of.

Once all the testing is complete, the best of the best are sorted and placed on the list. It can be tricky picking the top tier computers. But some, like the Spectre x360, are easy to select because they are such good machines. 

For a more detailed look at how we test laptops at ZDNET, check out our [laptop testing methodology page](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-laptops/).

## Which laptop brand is most reliable?

Among the touchscreen brands, the best ones are HP, Lenovo, and Dell. Unsurprisingly all three of those companies show up on this list. HP, in particular, earned two top spots and one down below in the alternative section. The company consistently makes some of the best touchscreen laptops on the market.

HP's devices strike a good balance of power and durability. Dell is similar to HP as it also launches consistently good products with a stronger emphasis on performance. Lenovo does things a little differently. While the company makes traditional laptops, Lenovo isn't afraid to experiment and release devices with unique designs or features.

## Is it worth getting a laptop with a touchscreen?

Absolutely. Touchscreen laptops are fantastic. These types of devices offer benefits that improve efficiency and workflow that a traditional laptop cannot do. Gesture navigation is a unique functionality allowing users to quickly switch between apps on the fly. 

They also support styluses for taking direct notes on the screen or highlighting vital details. What's more, touchscreen laptops offer an easier learning curve for students who are more accustomed to using tablets or smartphones.

## What are the problems with touchscreen laptops?

Common problems with touchscreen laptops include -- but are not limited to -- an inability to adjust brightness, blurry displays, weird flashing, and unresponsiveness. Fixing any of these issues will depend on what brand of computer you have. Each company has its own diagnostics tools so we recommend going to the manufacturer's website to see what resources they offer.

## When is the best time of the year to buy a touchscreen laptop?

Touchscreen laptops go on sale multiple times throughout the year. Prices usually drop around major US holidays or designated sales events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. However, you can get major discounts during Amazon Prime Day, which is when the retailer slashes price tags for many products.

The next Prime Day event kicks off on Oct. 8 and Oct 9., and we have a [list of the best Prime Day deals so far](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-early-amazon-prime-day-deals-2024/). We highly recommend checking it out.

## Are there alternative touchscreen laptops worth considering?

We recommend the laptops listed above, but the devices below are also worth a second look.
