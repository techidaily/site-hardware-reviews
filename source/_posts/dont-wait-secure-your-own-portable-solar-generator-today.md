## Don't Wait: Secure Your Own Portable Solar Generator Today

Storm season is already here—get a portable solar generator before a storm knocks out your power.

 It's nearly summertime, which means it's about to be storm season for many. For some, like myself, it's already here, as I quickly learned when an early May tornado knocked my entire city's power out for an extended period. Even though officials and neighbors warned me to get a battery backup every year, I balked at the price—but now I'm balking at my grocery bill instead, as I had to throw the food out in my fridge and freezer.

 Many people own a [gasoline generator](https://www.amazon.com/Westinghouse-Outdoor-Power-Equipment-WGen3600cv/dp/B099KPJZ2P/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003299&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fget-a-solar-portable-power-station-before-you-need-it%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), which can be a decent solution. However, gas stations are always swamped after a severe storm, and there are risks to using something flammable to power your home. A [solar portable power station](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/easy-tutorial-downloading-and-installing-latest-xp-pen-drivers/) is a much safer option, and you don't even need to deal with the crowds at the pump.

 These solar power stations can power your essential appliances, including your fridge (although I'd recommend a [powered cooler](https://www.amazon.com/Ivation-Electric-Portable-Thermoelectric-Vehicles/dp/B09CJG22ZT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003299&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fget-a-solar-portable-power-station-before-you-need-it%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) for perishables so you can use the charge to power a [small griddle](https://www.amazon.com/LEBENLANG-electric-barbecue-Tepaniaky-certified/dp/B0CX33WDXK?th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003299&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fget-a-solar-portable-power-station-before-you-need-it%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate) to cook with). It's well worth the investment—but companies know that portable power station prices are a bit of a sticker shock. This time of year, you'll find some great deals on these power stations, which makes the price a lot easier to swallow.

 One of the best deals I've found so far is for the [VTOMAN FlashSpeed 1000](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CY499RYN?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003299&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fget-a-solar-portable-power-station-before-you-need-it%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Affiliate), a big solar portable power supply that promises quick charging when you need it, a jump starter for your car, the ability to power your critical appliances and machines through the night, and more. The Amazon reviews back these claims up, too!

 Normally, this power station is $999.99, but it's currently down to $449.99 when you clip the coupon on the store page, and frankly, that's an absolutely amazing deal.
