HP includes an AMD Radeon RX 6550M graphics card and a screen capable of a 144Hz refresh rate for buttery smooth action during fast-paced or action-heavy scenes in your favorite games. Additionally, this laptop uses an advanced technique for cooling the computer as hot air is blown out of the bottom of the laptop to ensure the computer maintains a good temperature while you game.

With 8GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 7000 series processor, this system has quick speeds and the ability to put the power to where your system needs it most. But, you'd think with all the powerful components in this laptop, the battery life would suffer. Wrong. This laptop features a battery that can last up to 8 hours and 15 minutes while being able to be charged up to 50% in as little as 30 minutes.
