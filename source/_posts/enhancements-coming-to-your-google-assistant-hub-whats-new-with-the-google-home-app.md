## Enhancements Coming to Your Google Assistant Hub: What's New with the Google Home App

One of the big concerns many people have with the Google Home app is the way it lacks proper support for Nest camerasâ€”particularly so for the first-gen Nest Doorbell. It's one of its bigger pain points. Now, however, thanks to a new update, this is finally changing.

[Google Nest](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/secure-your-digital-life-winning-crypto-apps-ranked-150-chars/) is rolling out a few updates for its camera and doorbell users as part of its Public Preview program. The most notable enhancement is expanded support for the first-generation wired Nest Doorbell (formerly Nest Hello) within the Google Home app. If you transfer your doorbell to the Public Preview program, you can now manage it seamlessly alongside other devices in the app. There are also a bunch of other notable changes and new features like an enhanced camera history experience with quick switching between timeline and event list views, accessible on both the app and web version.

 Additionally, Google Nest is introducing garage door detection for Nest Aware subscribers who own eligible cameras. This advanced AI-powered image detection feature can identify if a garage door has been left open and send a notification to the user, eliminating the need for additional hardware or sensors. You can opt to place your camera either inside or outside your garage so you have a clear line of sight to the garage door. The garage door detection feature is available in the US and Canada for Nest Aware subscribers with specific Nest Cam models.

 These features are available in the Google Home app's Public Preview branch. You can try them out, and Google is encouraging you to do so, but you should also be aware that these features aren't _quite_ finalized. Your house won't be set on fire if you use them, but there might be some bugs and malfunctions that Google has overlooked.
