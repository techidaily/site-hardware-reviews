### A cutting edge gaming desktop

**CPU:** Up to AMD Ryzen 9 7950X | **GPU:** Up to Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 | **RAM:** Up to 128GB | **Storage:** Up to 8TB 

The Aurora R15 from Alienware is the first gaming desktop to feature AMD's Ryzen 7000 series CPUs and Nvidia's RTX 4000 series graphics cards. The base model is built with an AMD Ryzen 7 7700X, 8GB of RAM, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050, and 256GB SSD; you can configure builds with up to a Ryzen 9 7950X, 128GB of RAM, 8TB of storage, and an RTX 4090\. But be prepared to pay a pretty penny. The RTX 4090 alone adds almost $1800 to the final price of the PC. But seeing as how that is about what you would expect to pay for the GPU on its own, and a pre-built PC may be the only way to guarantee you can actually get the new RTX 4000 cards, it is absolutely worth the extra money to future-proof your gaming rig.

## Alienware AW2521H

### The world's fastest gaming monitor

**Screen size:** 24.5 inches | **Resolution:** 1080p | **Response time:** 1ms | **Refresh rate:** 260Hz over DP | **Connectivity:** DisplayPort, HDMI, USB 3.2 | **Panel type:** LCD

Dell's gaming brand, Alienware, unveiled the world's fastest gaming monitor, the Alienware AW2521H. This 24.5-inch LCD monitor has a native refresh rate of 360Hz while using the DisplayPort, and a still-impressive 240Hz over HDMI connections. Coupled with the screen's support for Nvidia G-Sync VRR technology, you'll get some of the smoothest gaming action available without overclocking your screen. It also has an excellent 1ms response time for near-perfect input reactions. And though the 1080p HD resolution is a little disappointing, it's what makes the high refresh rate possible, and may open the doors to ultra-responsive, ultra-fast 1440p and UHD monitors in the future.

### A huge OLED monitor for PC and console gaming

**Screen size:** 48 inches | **Display type:** OLED | **Resolution:** 4K | **Refresh rate:** 120Hz | **Response time:** 0.1ms | **Connectivity:** DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-C, USB 3.2, Ethernet, AUX

BenQ is sort of one of those under-the-radar brands when it comes to gaming, but it does offer some excellent monitors. And the just-announced EX480UZ is no exception. This 48-inch OLED monitor provides excellent 4K resolution, 120Hz refresh rate, and a truly impressive 0.1ms response time. The OLED panel is capable of producing up to 98 percent of the DCI-P3 color gamut for better color accuracy in games while support for AMD FreeSync Premium VRR tech prevents screen tearing and stuttering. 

The monitor supports using a single keyboard and mouse to switch between PC and console gaming, though you can use a traditional controller for console games if you prefer. You can fine-tune the on-screen image with the HDRi hotkey, which allows you to change settings on-the-fly. The monitor also has built-in speakers for excellent sound without a headset, as well as a remote control for changing volume levels and adjusting menu settings.

## GE Profile smart mixer

### The ultimate kitchen helper

The GE Profile Smart Mixer is one of the coolest things to come out of CES this year. A potential rival for Kitchenaid, this smart mixer is designed from the ground up to turn your home kitchen into a gourmet canteen or patisserie. Not only does it have integration for Alexa and Hey Google, it also has a companion app for looking up recipes that guide you through the cooking process, step-by-step. 

The Profile Smart Mixer also has a digital scale built-in, which is perfect for cooks and bakers who prefer weight measurements to volume. The digital motor is equipped with an automatic sensor that can feel how thick or thin your dough is and adjusts torque output so you don't over or under-mix; and with the automatic shut off which powers down the mixer when your timer is done, you'll never have to worry about consistency ever again.

### Discreet, stylish OTC hearing aids

The Jabra Enhance Plus OTC hearing aids are an excellent, multipurpose piece of tech to help those with hearing loss. Unlike traditional hearing aids, these are designed to look like wireless earbuds, if just a little smaller; this helps make it easier for anyone who is self-conscious about using hearing aids, since they don't look like a traditional medical device. The earbuds feature a 4 microphone array for picking up crystal clear sounds and conversations, so you're never left out. The microphones also work with the adaptive listening mode, which automatically adjusts volume to suit your environment. They also have a Focus mode which uses directional beamforming to focus on sounds that are close by, while the Surround mode lets you take in ambient noise like traffic sounds. 

The earbuds have a great battery life, lasting up to 12 hours on a full charge. And the included charging case gives you an additional 23 hours of use for a total of 35 hours. This means that you can use them all day before you need to think about recharging.

## What is CES?

[CES](https://www.zdnet.com/article/zdnets-guide-to-ces-what-is-it-and-who-can-attend/) is a tech and trade convention that is held annually in Las Vegas. Every year, thousands of representatives from hundreds of brands come together for a few days to talk about exciting new tech in the pipeline for consumers. This tech can range from production software and logistics programs for manufacturing to consumer tech like smartphones, laptops, and gaming monitors. 

## When is CES 2023?

This year, CES is being held from Thursday, Jan. 5 to Sunday, Jan. 8.

## Why is some CES 2023 tech not up for sale or pre-order yet?

While it's always frustrating to rush to pre-order cool new tech announced at CES 2023 and other tech shows, only to find they won't be available until fall or winter. Companies often use CES and other trade shows to not only announce and sell new tech, but to build relationships with PR agents and journalists. Tech that gets announced, but not a pre-order link, is usually something that is almost ready for market but is absolutely ready for testing by reviewers. 

It also gives companies the chance to get everyone excited for new features and designs, answer questions from journalists and consumers, and get the marketing machine in motion for when the product actually drops. So while you're able to get your hands on a few things from this year's CES, you'll have to be patient for some otehrs.

## Where can I see what other tech announced at CES 2023?

You can catch up with all of the pre-show announcements and the biggest reveals 's [CES 2023 hub page](https://www.zdnet.com/topic/ces-2023-the-biggest-trends-for-pros/)! Check back often to stay up-to-date on the latest laptops, monitors, and other tech announced from brands like Acer, Samsung, and TCL.
