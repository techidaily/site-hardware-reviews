Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reports that Apple is preparing for its largest AirPods launch ever. The company is gearing up to manufacture at least 20 million new AirPods units and anticipates releasing them next month during Apple's annual hardware event.

The new [AirPods](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airpods/) will replace the second- and third-generation base model AirPods. One pair has a codename ending in E for "entry," and the other's codename ends in M for "mid-tier," so we can infer that one model will have more upgraded features than the other. Both AirPods will debut a new design, improved fit, and compatibility with USB-C charging. 

Both models are also expected to have enhanced noise isolation capabilities and Spatial Audio compatibility -- features that have historically been reserved for Apple's premium headphones and earbuds.

Gurman says the upgraded model will have active noise-canceling technology and Find My speakers in the case, similar to the [AirPods Pro (2nd gen)](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-airpods-pro-2nd-generation-with-magsafe-case-usbc-white%2F6447382.p%3FskuId%3D6447382&publisher%5Fslug=zdnet&article%5Fname=apple%20will%20release%20two%20airpods%20models%20next%20month%20-%20everything%20we%20know%20so%20far&article%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Farticle%2Ftwo-new-airpods-models-expected-this-fall-heres-everything-we-know-so-far%2F&exclusive=1&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp).

Apple previously reserved noise-canceling tech for its premium earbuds, but the ANC earbud market has become significantly more competitive. There are high-quality [noise-canceling earbuds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-noise-canceling-earbuds/) that cost less than AirPods Pro, such as the [OnePlus Buds 3](https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/5597632/916678/12532?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-buds-3&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) and the [JLab JBuds ANC 3](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJLab-Wireless-Charging-Canceling-Multipoint%2Fdp%2FB0CGGWCPWS%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6271a331-3957-4454-a7e3-eb8732e370f3%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

Base model AirPods are made from hard plastic and resemble Apple's [original EarPods](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMMTN2AM%2FA%2Fearpods-lightning-connector&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). Due to their build, some people say the base model AirPods are uncomfortable to wear for long periods.

However, with a redesign for improved fit, the new AirPods could sport foam or silicone ear tips like the upgraded Pro version. A new version of AirPods Pro is slated to come out next year. 

It's unclear how Apple plans to continue distinguishing itself in the premium earbuds space. Still, with new AirPods coming this fall, Apple also has plans to include upgraded software for compatible AirPods within iOS 18\. Apple is reportedly working on giving [AirPods Pro a hearing aid](https://www.zdnet.com/article/airpods-pro-reportedly-will-gain-a-hearing-aid-mode-with-ios-18-no-hardware-update-needed/) mode, but few details are publicly available. 

The new AirPods are likely to debut alongside new iPhones, iPads, and Macs.
