Popular consumer audio brand [Beyerdynamic](https://north-america.beyerdynamic.com/ifa-2024) announced new flagship headphones and true wireless earbuds during IFA 2024 in Berlin, Germany. On Thursday, the German audio brand debuted the Aventho 300 over-ear headphones and the Amiron 300 true wireless earbuds. 

The new flagship headphones offer listeners modern features and upgrades. According to Beyerdynamic, the Aventho 300 headphones prioritize comfort with their high-grade swivel, aluminum yokes, and ergonomic design. According to a press release, the headphones are built with all-day comfort in mind, and the brand's Stellar.45 drivers are embedded into the headset for a rich sound experience. The Aventho 300 are compatible with a host of audio codecs, like AAC, LE Audio, aptX Adaptive, and aptX Lossless.

The Aventho 300 offer up to 50 hours of battery life, noise-canceling and transparency modes powered by dual Sony chipsets, and spatial audio with Dolby Head Tracking technology, an increasingly popular audio feature for premium headphones. Beyerdynamic's new over-ear headphones are equipped with Bluetooth 5.4, which promises more stable connections and higher-quality audio playback.

Beyerdynamic's new true wireless earbuds, the Amiron 300, also include several advanced features within a light and wireless package. According to Beyerdynamic, the Amiron 300 earbuds are designed with a flat back, so you can listen to them while lying on your side with no discomfort. The company says the Amiron 300 prioritizes "deep bass, precise mids, and crystal-clear highs."
