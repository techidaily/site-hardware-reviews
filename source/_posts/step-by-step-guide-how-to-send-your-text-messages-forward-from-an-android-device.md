 The exact steps to forward a message will vary slightly depending on your phone model and texting app. In this guide, we use Google's official Messages app to show you how to perform the process.

##  Forward a Text Using the Messages App on Android

 To start the process, launch Messages on your Android phone. Then, find and access the conversation in which your message is located.

 Tap and hold on the message to forward. Then, in your screen's top-right corner, select the three dots.

![Tap the three dots in the top-right corner.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/1-android-message-menu.png) 

 In the three-dot menu, choose "Forward."

![Select "Forward" in the menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/2-android-forward-message.png) 

 You'll see a "Forward Message" window listing your recent message senders and receivers. Tap someone on this list to forward them your message.

 To enter a phone number or choose someone from your contacts, tap "New Message."

 On the "New Conversation" page, at the top, tap the "To" field and enter the phone number you want to forward your message to. Alternatively, on the same page, choose a person from your contact list.
