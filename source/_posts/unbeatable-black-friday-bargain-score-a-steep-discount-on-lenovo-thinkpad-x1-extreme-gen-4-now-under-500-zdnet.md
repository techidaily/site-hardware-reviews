Lenovo's ThinkPads are known for their iconic looks including the red trackpoint, excellent keyboards and solid build quality. The [ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 4](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-Extreme-Touchscreen-Workstation-Thunderbolt%2Fdp%2FB09RQNBNWL%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cd1ce0152-0b7c-42fa-9328-53f7eac42184%7Cdtp&dtb=1) has all this, plus a specification that will serve anyone needing to run demanding workloads -- including designers, architects, engineers and creators. Its 16-inch screen hits an increasingly popular sweet spot for laptops, providing more real estate than a 15.6-inch device, and (generally) better portability than a 17-inch one.

The ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 4 measures 14.13 inches wide by 9.99 inches deep by 0.7 inches thick and weighs 3.99lbs, so it's no thin-and-light laptop, but it's military-grade robust and its 90Wh battery should last for up to 10 hours should you take it on your travels, according to Lenovo. Remote workers will appreciate the X1 Extreme's 1080p webcam, dual far-field mics and decent speaker system.
