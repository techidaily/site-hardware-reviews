Apple's MacBook Air ranks at the top of [ZDNET's list of best Macs of 2023](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mac/) and as [ZDNET's 2022 product of the year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m2-macbook-air-zdnets-product-of-the-year/).

If you are looking for a computer that will do the heavy lifting on video editing, look elsewhere. But for 95% of the other tasks you'd regularly use a computer for, the MacBook Air performs. "The MacBook Air continues to be the perfect Mac for someone who doesn't do much more than web browsing, school or enterprise work in Office apps, and/or occasional video or photo editing," ZDNET contributor [Jason Cipriani writes](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mac/). 

The MacBook Air comes in three sizes: 13.3 inches, 13.6 inches, or 15.3 inches. The battery life is a strong and sturdy 18 hours to last you well beyond your regular workday. Plus, with up to 2TB of storage, you can store photos, videos, and plenty of documents on the laptop before ever needing an upgrade.

When ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner tried the MacBook Air out for himself, he was surprised by its workhorse capabilities. "I transferred monstrously large files, built multimedia-intense PowerPoints, rendered and compressed video files, and loaded up my three favorite Adobe Creative Cloud apps -- Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Lightroom. I was very surprised to find that the machine never blinked, " [Hiner writes](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m2-macbook-air-zdnets-product-of-the-year/).
