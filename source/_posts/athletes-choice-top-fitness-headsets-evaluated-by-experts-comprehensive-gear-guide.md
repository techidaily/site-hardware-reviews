## Athlete's Choice: Top Fitness Headsets Evaluated by Experts | Comprehensive Gear Guide

Listening to music or a podcast may make your workout feel like it's going by faster, but that's only if your headphones are up to the sweaty challenge. It can feel nearly impossible to go on a run or finish your reps without your favorite songs blasting in your ears. As an avid runner, I need my earbuds to be charged and ready to play my favorite songs before I can pound the pavement. 

ZDNET and our team of exercise and headphone enthusiasts have done most of the figurative and literal heavy lifting by testing out our favorite earbuds and headphones at the gym, on runs, and while we stay active. We've logged miles and sweat with these headsets and considered options for all budgets. Needless to say, we've got some strong opinions on what makes a good workout headphone.

### Shokz OpenRun Pro

#### Best headphones for working out overall

Finding the right earbuds to work out in is challenging, especially if you sweat a lot. [Bone conduction headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-bone-conduction-headphones/) might be the perfect solution. By wrapping around your head and sitting near instead of entirely in your ear, the Shokz OpenRun Pros transmit sound through the bone architecture, allowing your ears to breathe. This is great for anybody who exercises for a long time, like people training for a half marathon or cyclists going on hours-long bike rides. 

The headphones deliver a 10-hour battery life, and according to [Jack Wallen's testing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-sweat-so-much-it-damages-earbuds-heres-what-i-wear-to-run-now-instead/), he's gotten close to a week's worth of running without needing to charge. In addition to the long-lasting battery, Wallen was also impressed with their sweatproof capabilities, especially given his track record of ruining running earbuds and their quality sound performance. 

**Review:** [**Shokz OpenRun Pro**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-sweat-so-much-it-damages-earbuds-heres-what-i-wear-to-run-now-instead/)

"The OpenRun Pro sound offers more bass than you'd expect for a pair of bone-conducting headphones, and the fit is so minimal that you forget they're on your head," says Wallen. 

Finally, another 'pro' of bone-conducting headphones is the ability to hear your surroundings. This is especially important for outdoor runners who should be constantly aware of their surroundings, and Wallen assured that the OpenRun Pros helped him "avoid disaster." 

Bone conduction headphones aren't for everyone, but if you love exercising outdoors, rain or shine, want environmental awareness, decent sound for your music and podcasts, and a long battery life, the OpenRun Pro headphones are the platonic ideal of a workout headphone.

Pros 
* Long battery life
* Pinch controls are intuitive for exercise
* Sounds great

Cons 
* Not the strongest ANC out of all the earbud options

### Nothing Ear (a)

#### Best workout earbuds for most people

I loved these earbuds so much while I was training for my half marathon that out of all the many earbuds I test for my job, these were the only ones I used the day of my race. 

The Nothing Ear (a) earbuds are the best workout earbuds for most people for these three reasons. First is the price: They're only $100\. Second is sound: They sound incredible, with the perfect amount of noise cancellation that takes you away from distracting environmental noise without forcing complete unawareness. Third is touch controls: The Nothing Ear (a)'s touch controls mimic those of the AirPods Pro 2\. They use pinch controls on the bottom stem of the earbud instead of touch controls near the top. 

**Also:** [**Nothing Ear (a)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-99-transparent-earbuds-make-airpods-look-and-sound-boring/)

As I write in my spotlight, I always run with earbuds in. When my ears get too sweaty and whatever pair of earbuds I wear begins to slip out, I accidentally touch and activate the pause button when attempting to press the bud back into my ears. Having pinch controls on the stem of the earbud negates this annoying issue. 

The three reasons above justify the Nothing Ear (a) as one of the best workout earbuds. But one extra feature that sweetens the deal is how cool these look in your ears. The transparent design is unique and creative, and the earbuds come in this sunshine yellow color (although you can also pick them up in white or black if you're looking for a less flashy earbud). 

The ear tips are super tactile and stick to your ears as you run and move, making them great for working out. They come with IP55 waterproofing, a solid and long battery life, and will work for Android and iOS users. All in all, these are a joy to use and exercise with, and it's refreshing to see technology packed with every feature you want, designed thoughtfully, and priced competitively. Apple should be scared. 

**Nothing Ear (a) specs:** **Weight:** 4.8g | **Battery life:** 9.5 hours in buds and 42.5 in case with ANC off | **Bluetooth version:** 5.3 | **Waterproof:** IP54 | **Noise cancellation:** Active noise cancellation

Pros 
* Allows for environmental awareness
* Impressive battery life
* Great alternative to bone-conduction headphones

Cons 
* No touch controls
* No noise cancellation
* Slight sound leakage

### Bose Ultra Open Earbuds

#### Best high-end workout headphones

As I write in my spotlight of these unique earbuds, the Bose Ultra Open is "ideal for runners who want to enjoy their music while remaining aware of their environment, thanks to Bose's OpenAudio technology." Not everyone wants to be completely cut off from the sounds around them while on a run or at the gym. As an alternative to bone-conduction headphones, the Bose Ultra Open earbuds allow maximum environmental awareness while playing music simultaneously. The compact G-shaped design fits comfortably in your ear, almost like a clip-on earring, and despite their light weight, they are unlikely to budge even while running, lifting, or jumping around. I shook my head, expecting these to fall out of my ears, but they never did. 

**Review:** [**Bose Ultra Open Earbuds**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-run-with-these-bose-earbuds-instead-of-bone-conduction-headphones/)

While wearing these and running on a busy street filled with honking cars, I felt surprised by the near-magic of simultaneous awareness. I wasn't sacrificing my music for the traffic around me, nor the traffic sounds for the music. 

The earbuds have an IPX4 rating and an impressive 7.5 hours of battery life. Still, they don't have any noise cancellation technology, so they're the best fit for normal to moderately noisy environments where the ambient noise isn't going to override your tunes. 

The one downside of these earbuds is the high price. Most people wouldn't want to spend $300 on earbuds to exercise in. Still, if you care a lot about stellar sound in your earbuds and want environmental awareness during your listening sessions, the Bose Ultra Open earbuds are in a league of their own. 

**Bose Ultra Open s** **pecs:** **Weight:** 11.2 ounces | **Battery life:** 7.5 hours | **Bluetooth version:** 5.3 | **Waterproof:** IPX4 | **Noise cancellation:** N/A

Pros 
* Comfortable fit
* Long battery life
* Fan-favorite headphone

Cons 
* Expensive
* Some users prefer the XM4 fit to the XM5

### Sony WH-1000XM5

#### Best over-ear headphones for working out

Headphones tend to be bulky while you exercise, but these fan-favorites from Sony pack a comfortable punch; Sony's WH-1000XM5 delivers superior sound, a comfortable form factor, and a lightweight design, all features that gave them ZDNET's title as one of the[over-ear headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-over-ear-headphones/). These are also Virginia Wooten's, CEO and founder of [Dawn Fitness](https://www.dawnfitness.co/), favorite headphones for whenever she hits the gym or goes for runs outside. "\[They have the\] best sound quality I could ask for, and I love how they look and feel as an over-the-ear headphone," said Wooten. 

Powered by the QN1 Sony HD Noise Cancelling Processor, the Sony WH-1000XM5 Noise Cancelation is not only top-notch but customizable thanks to the Auto NC Optimizer, which automatically adjusts to the noise in your workout environment. Plus, the headphones pack in up to thirty hours of continuous music playback, so you can focus on supercharging your workouts instead of your headphones.

### Apple AirPods Pro (2nd generation)

#### Best workout headphones for Apple owners

Out of all the AirPods models, the AirPods Pro 2 are hands down the best earbuds for iPhone users. With seamless iOS compatibility and Find My embedded into the buds, it makes sense why any Apple devotee would opt for AirPods over another brand. 

Take all those native perks and add in competitive ANC, spatial audio, waterproofing, and ear tips that should fit most ears. 

When a former ZDNET associate editor [tested](https://www.zdnet.com/article/airpods-pro-2-offer-two-big-upgrades-but-connectivity-chaos-hasnt-been-tamed/) the second-gen Pros, she was impressed when they passed her sweaty sprint test on the treadmill with flying colors. 

**Review:** [**AirPods Pro 2**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-airpods-pro-2-review/)

Along with fit, the AirPods Pro 2 are also able to block out the awkward weight clanking and grunting at the gym with excellent ANC. And with a transparency mode that lives up to the name, these AirPods are ideal for city runs where you still want to lock into the music without being hit by a car. Lasting six hours on a single charge and up to 30 while in the charging case, the second-gen Pros are a "no-brainer" accessory to throw in your gym bag and go.

### JLab JBuds ANC 3

#### Best budget workout earbuds

I can understand why people wouldn't want to spend an arm and a leg on headphones that they sweat in every day. That's where a good pair of affordable earbuds, like the JLab JBuds ANC 3, come in. These are $60 with competitive ANC, a marathon battery life in the earbuds plus 33 hours in the case, multipoint Bluetooth, and a tight and comfortable fit in my ears. I used these while training for my half marathon and loved how long I could go without charging them, especially as I was pounding pavement day in and day out.

## What are the best workout headphones?

The best workout headphones depend on your preference, like whether you want a bone conduction headphone, an over-ear headphone, an earbud, or something in between.

## Which headphones for working out are right for you?

Much like fitness, earbuds don't have a "one size fits all" approach -- it ultimately comes down to preference. And while specs speak for themselves, there are specific scenarios in which it's better to invest in one headphone pair over the other. Here's a chart to help you compare.

| **Choose** **these** **workout** **headphones...** | **If** **you...**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## Factors to consider when choosing headphones for working out

These headphones were chosen based on an array of factors including:

* **Fit**: From multiple ear tips to extra-soft materials, there are several ways to make your workout and running headphones more comfortable while you exercise.
* **Water resistance**: The waterproof rating for your workout headphones is important in case you find yourself caught in a sudden downpour or in the middle of an especially vigorous workout. Some charging cases even include waterproofing.
* **Sound quality**: After all, what good are your headphones if you cannot hear your audio? Some headphones feature better technology than others to offer improved sound and call quality.
* **Special features**: Spatial awareness can be improved with bone conduction, while active noise cancellation can help drown out the outside world so you can get lost in your workout. Whatever you prefer, consider which audio features are available for your next workout and running headphones.
* **Price**: The price for your headphones can vary significantly, with our top picks running from $50 to $250\. Your budget may determine which workout and running headphones are available to you.

## How we test headphones for working out

If I didn't exercise in these headphones myself, one of my trusted colleagues has. Here at ZDNET, we only recommend products we have used ourselves, and use these products every day to understand just how long the battery life actually lasts, how the noise cancellation sounds in a loud environment, and how the microphones sound on calls and Zooms. 

**Also:** [**How we test headphones**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-headphones/)

## Is it better to work out with headphones or earbuds?

Ultimately, it's not "better" or "worse" to work out with over-ear headphones versus in-ear buds, it simply comes down to preference. As a perfuse sweater, I prefer in-ear buds to avoid over-ear padding from getting soaked or potent. However, many strength trainers prefer over-ear models for stability, while sweaty runners opt for a [bone conducting](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-bone-conduction-headphones/) option.

## Are bone conduction headphones good for working out?
