## Week in Review: Latest iPhone Software Enhancements & Product Recalls

This was a big week for tech news, with Apple’s WWDC event, Microsoft’s ongoing Recall problems, and everything in between. Here are the biggest stories you might have missed.

##  The Big News

### [Jabra Is Done Making Elite and Talk Wireless Earbuds](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/avoid-complexity-top-5-free-tools-for-effortless-gif-to-video-transformation/) 

 Jabra won’t make any more wireless earbuds and headsets under its consumer Elite and Talk brands, and instead will go back to focusing on business customers. The news was announced the same day as the [Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2](https://location-social.techidaily.com/top-7-skype-hacker-to-hack-any-skype-account-on-your-realme-note-50-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) and Elite Active Gen 2 were released.

### [Windows 11 Recall Feature Is on Hold](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/ing-tips-select-the-top-5-url-shrinkers-for-youtube-for-2024/) 

 Microsoft revealed a new Recall feature for Windows 11 back in May, promising a searchable timeline for your entire PC history using generative AI. A few changes were [announced last week](https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-best-of-yt-a-deep-dive-into-music-dance-clips-23/) after significant security problems were discovered, and now Microsoft is fully delaying it.

### [Apple Bakes More Predatory Lending Options Into the iPhone](https://audio-shaping.techidaily.com/updated-free-web-based-daws-that-are-changing-music-production-the-top-10-for-2024/) 

 As if the Apple credit card and Pay Later service weren't enough.

### [Microsoft is Reinforcing Outlook With New Security Changes](https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/unleash-the-power-of-ai-5-ways-chatgpt-elevates-your-bitcoin-and-altcoin-strategies/)

### [Can’t Wait for Your Spotify Wrapped? Get Ready for “My Spotify”](https://driver-download.techidaily.com/1722964857222-cross-platform-support-download-m-audio-fast-track-drivers-suitable-for-windows-11-7-8-and-eight/) 

 Spotify is rolling out a new highlight summary to subscribers, called My Spotify. It’s sort of like a mid-year version of the yearly Wrapped summaries.

Samsung

### [The Galaxy Watch FE Is Just an Old Watch with a New Name](https://techidaily.com/how-to-get-out-of-recovery-or-dfu-mode-on-apple-iphone-11-drfone-by-drfone-ios-system-repair-ios-system-repair/) 

 Samsung is preparing to launch the Galaxy Watch FE, a $200 rehash of the three-year-old Galaxy Watch 4\. It gives customers a cheaper alternative to Samsung's flagship smartwatches, but it's an odd duck.

##  The Other Stuff

_Reuters_ reports that [MediaTek is working on ARM-based processors](https://www.reuters.com/technology/mediatek-designs-arm-based-chip-microsofts-ai-laptops-say-sources-2024-06-11/) for Windows PCs. That could make MediaTek another competitor for chips in ARM laptops, as the [first Windows laptops](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/enhancing-stories-through-animations-with-movie-maker/) with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Elite chips are about to arrive. AMD and NVIDIA are also rumored to be working on PC ARM chips.

 Meanwhile, Microsoft announced an [all-digital Xbox Series X](https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/06/09/xbox-series-x-s-new-console-options/), with no disc drive and a lower $450 price tag. There will also be a new limited edition 2TB regular Xbox Series X and a 1TB Series S.
