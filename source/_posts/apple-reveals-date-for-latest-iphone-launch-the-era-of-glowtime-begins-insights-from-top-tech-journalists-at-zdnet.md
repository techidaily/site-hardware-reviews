This year, Apple will release the iPhone 16 family, which reportedly has many AI-powered upgrades. Apple confirmed the iPhone event will happen on Sept. 9 at 10 a.m. PT. This year's theme is "It's Glowtime," and it's expected that Apple will announce a new Apple Watch and [two pairs of AirPods](https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-new-airpods-models-expected-this-fall-heres-everything-we-know-so-far/) alongside the iPhone.

The event takes place at Apple Park in Cupertino, California, but in-person attendance is reserved for the press. If you want to tune into the event, you can stream it live on [Apple's website](https://www.apple.com/) or [the company's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/apple). Although the iPhone is the main event, Apple will announce new software, including [iOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-can-be-updated-to-apples-new-ios-18-public-beta-and-which-ones-cant/), [iPadOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/article/4-major-ipados-18-features-announced-at-wwdc-2024-and-which-ipads-will-get-it/), [tvOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/tvos-18-will-enhance-the-dialogue-on-your-apple-tv-to-help-you-better-hear-it/), [WatchOS 11](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-apple-watch-is-getting-an-upgrade-here-are-the-best-features-in-watchos-11/), [VisionOS 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-visionos-2-features-unveiled-at-wwdc-2024-what-im-excited-about-and-puzzled-by/), and [MacOS Sequoia](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-apple-macbook-is-getting-a-free-upgrade-here-are-the-best-macos-15-features/).

During the event, Apple will showcase how [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-apple-intelligence-everything-to-know-about-ai-features-coming-to-iphones-macs-and-ipads/), its proprietary AI model, will interact with its smartphones, tablets, and laptops.

The iPhone 16 will have many on-device AI capabilities, like an emoji generator, enhanced photo editing, suggested text and email responses, and more.
