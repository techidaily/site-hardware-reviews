## Introducing the Acer Vero Range - Combining Elegant Design with User-Friendly Technology for Laser Projectors

Acer is preparing to launch a pair of nearly-identical long throw laser projectors, the Vero HL6810 and Vero HL6810ATV. Both offer a 4K resolution with 4,000 ANSI lumens of brightness and can produce a 100-inch image at a throw distance of 2.5 meters or 8 feet.

 The [Vero HL6810](https://www.acer.com/gb-en/projectors/vero/pdp/MR.JX511.007) and [Vero HL6810ATV](https://www.acer.com/gb-en/projectors/vero/pdp/MR.JWW11.002) use a hybrid laser-LED light source, hence the 4,000 lumens rating (which is perfect for daytime use). They also provide a 50,000:1 contrast ratio, support HDR10, and reach 105% of the Rec. 709 color gamut. And I appreciate that Acer included some advanced functionality like vertical lens shift (55%65%), a 1.3x manual zoom lens, and a gaming mode that hits a 240Hz refresh rate at 1080p resolution.

 Acer is sticking with a relatively simple port selection: two HDMI 2.0b ports, a USB-A port (to power streaming sticks or other accessories), a 3.5mm audio output, and a RS-232 serial port (for businesses with multi-room AV distribution systems). This should be fine for most users, and those who need additional HDMI ports can use an [AVR](https://www.amazon.com/Denon-AVR-S760H-7-2-Channel-Theater-Receiver/dp/B09HY24XVW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003290&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Facer-vero-laser-projectors-hl6810-series%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) or [soundbar](https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/how-to-keep-the-conversation-flowing-on-discord/) to expand the port selection.

 To my delight, neither of these projectors have built-in smart TV software. Instead, they use a simple software interface and must be connected to an external device for streaming. On that note, the only difference between the Vero HL6810 and the Vero HL6810ATV is that the latter model includes an Android TV dongle (hence the "ATV" at the end of its model name).

 A projector that has built-in smart TV software [will age poorly](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-infinite-jest-joyride-top-kids-game-lineup/), as the smart TV software will eventually go out of date. But an external dongle, like the one that's in the Vero HL6810ATV, can be replaced at any time and has zero impact on the projector's basic functionality. For reference, the Vero HL6810ATV has a dedicated port and power supply for its dongle—it doesn't take up one of the two HDMI ports.

 Acer promises a 30,000 hour lifespan for its new projectors. So, if you habitually use one of these projectors for five hours each day, it'll stop working around the 16-year mark. Disabling ECO mode knocks the lifespan down to 20,000 hours, which equates to 11 years if you use the projector for five hours a day.

 And, like many Acer products, the new Vero HL68 Series laser projectors boast an "eco-friendly" design. Post-consumer recycled plastic is incorporated into the projectors' chassis, and recycled paper is included in the packaging. Acer also brags that these projectors use a "100% mercury-free" light source, but this is true of all laser projectors, so it isn't really a selling point unless you're comparing a Vero HL68 Series projector to a traditional lamp projector (which will always contain mercury).

 Acer will launch the dongle-equipped [Vero HL6810ATV](https://www.acer.com/gb-en/projectors/vero/pdp/MR.JWW11.002) projector in June with prices starting at €1,699\. The [Vero HL6810](https://www.acer.com/gb-en/projectors/vero/pdp/MR.JX511.007) arrives two months later for €1,599\. Sadly, this launch is exclusive to the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) market, and Acer hasn't announced a North American rollout.
