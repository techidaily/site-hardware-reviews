## How did I choose these gaming laptops?

Before you buy a gaming laptop, take a moment to reflect on these considerations.

* **Processor:** Also known as the CPU, the processor is like the brain of the computer, helping everything to run properly and quickly. Most gaming laptops incorporate processors like the Intel Core i9 or i7, or you may see an AMD Ryzen 7 or 9 processor in other laptops.

* **Connectivity:** Laptops generally do not offer as many ports as their desktop companions, but that does not mean you are out of luck. The best gaming laptops will offer plenty of options, such as USB-C, USB-A, Thunderbolt 4, and HDMI ports.
* **Price:** The cost of a good gaming laptop can vary significantly, with the difference ranging several thousands of dollars. Things like your processor, graphics card, and memory can all impact the price, so keep these things in mind when shopping. To help give you an idea of what to expect, we found that the best gaming laptops range from $650 to more than $3,800 in price.
