Amazon's [Prime Big Deal Days event](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/october-prime-day-2024-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-2024-10-07/) has officially concluded, but that doesn't mean great laptop deals have dried up. Case in point: right now, the [M2 Apple MacBook Air](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3CDZLTB%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Caeb0358d-7a98-4b5a-879b-52b109406434%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is on sale for just $749 at Amazon. That's 25% off the total price and the lowest price we've seen for this laptop since Best Buy offered it for the same rate back in July.

With new Apple products recently launched and the holiday season on the horizon, it's no surprise we're seeing such competitive sales, but this one deserves particular mention. Just note that as of right now, this deal is only live for the MacBook Air in the silver colorway. 

In response, [Walmart is also offering the MacBook Air M2 for $749](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-air-13-6-laptop-m2-chip-built-for-apple-intelligence-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-midnight%2F6509650.p&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) As of this writing, you can grab the other colors which are midnight, starlight, and space gray. 

Two years later, 2022's version of the lightweight powerhouse is still a solid machine, with competitive specs that compete with much newer laptops on the market. In fact, this laptop was [ZDNET's product of the year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m2-macbook-air-zdnets-product-of-the-year/) when it was released in 2022, punching well above its weight in terms of performance and quickly becoming a favorite for professionals looking for power and portability.

[M2 MacBook Air 2022 for $799 (Save $200 at Amazon) $799 at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F2022-Apple-MacBook-Laptop-chip%2Fdp%2FB0B3C2R8MP%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Caeb0358d-7a98-4b5a-879b-52b109406434%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

The 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air has an 8- and 10-core GPU and an impressive 18-hour battery life. The 8GB or 16GB of RAM can also be paired with up to 1TB of storage to future-proof the machine with additional storage. 

Apple's MacBook Air series is also perhaps one of the most popular ultraportable laptop families among consumers (and our pick for best overall ultraportable). It set an entirely new bar for performance with the introduction of Apple's Silicon chips in 2020 and has only improved since then. If you're looking for a secondary laptop you can take with you for travel or on the go, it doesn't get much lighter than the M2 MacBook Air.

Apple released its M3 MacBook Air lineup only nine months after the 15-inch M2 version was first announced in June 2023, marking what is likely to be a rapid succession of upgrades in the industry as a whole within the next few years. 

This makes now a great time to spring for a new MacBook Air. Thinner yet with a larger screen than previous versions, the 2022 13.6-inch M2 MacBook Air also comes with a vibrant screen with up to 500 nits of brightness and a 60Hz refresh rate, a 1080p FaceTime webcam, two USB-C Thunderbolt ports, and the coveted 3.5mm headphone jack. It also comes in four iconic color tones: midnight, silver, space gray, and starlight.

AI-powered laptops are the future, and right now, manufacturers are putting their attention into developing cutting-edge tech that harnesses these capabilities into new machines.

Most people don't need top-of-the-line AI integration just yet. The reality is that day-to-day workflows for most people are still reliant on powerful, reliable laptops that can tackle whatever you throw at it, and the [M2 MacBook Air](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0B3CDZLTB%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Caeb0358d-7a98-4b5a-879b-52b109406434%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is a machine that fulfills exactly that need, while being light as air.
