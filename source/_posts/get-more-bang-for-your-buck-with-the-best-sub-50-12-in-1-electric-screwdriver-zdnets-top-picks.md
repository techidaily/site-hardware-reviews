* The [Hoto 12-in-1 electric screwdriver](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHOTO-Screwdriver-Electric-Cordless-Shadowless%2Fdp%2FB08Z74BLX9%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1c397782-8666-4103-a15d-044478906f88%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is typically priced at $70, but you can get a limited-time deal for under $50.
* This electric screwdriver has a fast 220 RPM motor, two buttons for screwing in and out for ease of use, three torque settings for different tasks, a circular LED shadowless lamp for better visibility, and includes 12 S2 tool steel bits.
* While durable and reliable, the Hoto 12-in-1 electric screwdriver lacks a super-gentle setting for delicate tasks, making it too powerful for small intricate jobs.

I use a lot of screwdrivers, and I've found that while it's hard to beat a decent set of traditional screwdrivers (here is [a great set by Klein Tools](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FKlein-Tools-85148-Screwdriver-Demagnetizer%2Fdp%2FB07W7VCQK3%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1c397782-8666-4103-a15d-044478906f88%7Cdtp&dtb=1) that will last you a lifetime), there are times when electric screwdrivers can take the strain off my hands and wrists. 

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Hoto 3.6V cordless electric screwdriver This electric screwdriver is efficient and easy to use, capable if driving over 1,000 screws on a single charge.

I believe in thoroughly testing tools, and the one I've been testing hard for over a year now is the [Hoto 3.6V cordless 1,500mAh electric screwdriver](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHOTO-Screwdriver-Electric-Cordless-Shadowless%2Fdp%2FB08Z74BLX9%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1c397782-8666-4103-a15d-044478906f88%7Cdtp&dtb=1) which has proved itself to be a worthy addition to my toolkit.

## Hoto electric screwdriver tech specs

* Rotary knob switches the screwdriver between three different torque settings
* Fast driving, thanks to a 220 RPM motor
* A massive 1,500mAh capacity battery provides ultra-long endurance and, when fully charged, can drive in more than 1,000 screws before needing a recharge
* The screwdriver features a circular LED shadowless lamp, so you can see what you're doing
* The Hoto cordless screwdriver set contains a dozen two-inch long S2 tool steel long bits with hardness up to 60HRC
* The screwdriver and bits are stored in the anodized aluminum alloy storage box that has a soft, rubber top handle
* The Universal Type-C charging interface means you don't need a separate charger

On the one end of this superb screwdriver is a standard 1/4-inch socket that takes the various bits, and behind that is a rotary knob that switches the screwdriver off and on and also switches between three torque settings. There's also a circular LED shadowless lamp, so you can see what you're doing, which is a nice touch because it means I don't have to wrangle a flashlight [when I'm working](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/this-60-tool-essentially-gives-you-another-pair-of-hands/) in a dark area.

On the other end of the screwdriver, there's a USB-C port for charging the unit -- a neat touch because it eliminates the need for a proprietary charger (I don't need any more of those in my life).

The controls are about as simple as they get and are located in the middle of the tool. There's a button to screw a screw in and a button to screw a screw out.

The screwdriver and bits are stored in the anodized aluminum alloy storage box that has a soft, rubber top handle. If you want more than the dozen bits, Hoto has a [version with 25 bits in a different case for a few dollars more](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHOTO-Electric-Screwdriver-Cordless-Mechanical-dp-B0BLMQ8BXB%2Fdp%2FB0BLMQ8BXB%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1c397782-8666-4103-a15d-044478906f88%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

This is how you remove the Hoto electric screwdriver from its aluminum carry case.

The three torque settings range from powerful enough to assemble a PC case or flat pack furniture (where you need quite low power) to [powerful enough](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/youll-never-guess-how-many-tech-repair-tools-this-little-bag-can-fit/) to put a fence up or screw down floorboards. 

This screwdriver doesn't offer a super-gentle setting for things such as electronic gadgets, which this screwdriver might be too powerful for. This is where a [mini-precision electric screwdriver](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FElectric-Screwdriver-Precision-Magnetic-Cordless%2Fdp%2FB09N3KQQ5K%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1c397782-8666-4103-a15d-044478906f88%7Cdtp&dtb=1) complements the Hoto screwdriver well (and this is also on sale right now).

### ZDNET's buying advice

Aside from the lack of a super-gentle setting, the [Hoto electric screwdriver with a dozen bits](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHOTO-Screwdriver-Electric-Cordless-Shadowless%2Fdp%2FB08Z74BLX9%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C1c397782-8666-4103-a15d-044478906f88%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is a great choice -- especially at this lower price point. Mine has already had well over a year of use now, undertaking tasks such as assembling PC cases, putting together flat-pack furniture, and being abused driving six-inch screws into plastic door and window frames, and it is still going strong. 

It's more than paid for itself!
