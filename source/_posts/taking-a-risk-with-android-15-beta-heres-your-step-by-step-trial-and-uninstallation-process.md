The [roadmap](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15)specifically mentions releases up until July. We can get a taste of it right now, though.

##  How to Enroll in the Android 15 Beta

 Joining the Android 14 Beta program is extremely easy. There's no downloading ROMs and flashing software involved. First, head over to the [Android Beta website](https://www.google.com/android/beta) in a web browser and ensure you're signed in with the same Google account you use on your Pixel phone.

 If you install the Android 15 Beta, you will not be able to go back to Android 14 without wiping all data from the device. 

 Next, review the information on the website and scroll down to "Your Eligible Devices." Here's where you'll see your eligible Pixel phone listed. Click "Opt In" for the device you want to use.

 Read the terms and check the appropriate boxesâ€”there are a couple of email lists you can join as well. Select "Confirm and Enroll" to continue.

 Now, over on the phone you selected, the Android 15 beta update will appear just like a typical update. You can manually check for it by going to Settings > System > Software Updates. Tap "Download and Install" when it arrives.

 If, for some reason, this doesn't work for you, you can also [download the OTA image](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/15/download-ota) for your specific Pixel and [manually sideload it](https://facebook-record-videos.techidaily.com/updated-the-path-to-wealthy-creatorland-for-ajey-nagar/).

##  Go Back to Android 14 From Android 15 Beta

 The process for going back to Android 14 from Android 15 Beta is easy, but it will wipe your device. Opting out of the beta will send a new OTA update to your device. This update will wipe your phone and install Android 14, bringing it back to the factory defaults. **Back up all important data before proceeding.** 

 All you have to do is go back to the [Android Beta Program](http://www.google.com/android/beta) website and click "Opt Out" for your device.

![Opt out of the Android 15 beta.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024-04-18_12-15-40.png)

 Then select "Leave Beta" on the pop-up window.

 Now, you can go back to your phone and install the new update that appears. As with installing Android 15 Beta, you can also choose to sideload the Android 14 OTA image manually. This will still wipe the device back to factory defaults, though.
