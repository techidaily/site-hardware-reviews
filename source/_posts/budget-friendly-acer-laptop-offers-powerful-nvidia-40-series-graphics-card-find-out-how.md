## How did we choose these cheap Windows laptops?

We chose these laptops after extensive research into the product category. We compared factors like pricing, reviews (both good and bad), different specs, as well as renowned brand names in the space.

* **Price:** A good laptop doesn't need to cost you over $1,000 to perform the regular responsibilities of schoolwork and job assignments.
* **Specs:** Some laptops have great memory, long battery life, storage, pristine resolution, and a wide display. While you don't need every single spec to be top tier just to write an essay or submit your physics homework, we compared these essential specs to other laptops on the market.
* **Functionality:** Some laptops are lightweight, while others weigh a ton. Some double as tablets and boast touchscreens. We considered how these aspects of the laptops would cater to a student or employee's needs.

## Can all these laptops run Windows 11?

It's always recommended that you check the tech specs and user manual of your laptop to see what version of Windows it's running. But the Dell Inspiron 15 3000 has Windows 11 already installed, and the Acer Aspire 5 is eligible for a free Windows 11 upgrade.

## What are budget laptops best suited for?

You're looking at a system that can handle the general activities people do at work or school (as long as they don't include things like pro-grade photo and video editing and playing games and that sort of activities). These systems are general-purpose systems, but don't expect them to handle heavy workloads.

## What kind of battery life can I expect from a budget laptop?

[Battery life](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-battery-life-laptop/) all depends on how you're using your laptop. If you're doing very light workloads like web browsing or word processing, you'll get the maximum run time out of your new laptop. For example: the Dell Inspiron 15 3000 has a maximum battery life of 7.5 hours. So if you're just catching up on news headlines or your kids are doing homework, you'll get fairly close to that number. But if you're streaming music, movies, or shows, you'll get a bit less, and your laptop will die fairly quickly if you're trying to edit photos and videos.

## Are there alternative cheap Windows laptops worth considering?

The above cheap Windows laptops are the best on the market in terms of price, functionality, and tech specs, but if you're looking for more options, here are some noteworthy alternatives to consider.
