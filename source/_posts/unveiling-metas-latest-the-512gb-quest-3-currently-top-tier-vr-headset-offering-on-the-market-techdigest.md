The Meta Quest 3 gets a price drop this fall.

At the [Meta Connect event](https://www.zdnet.com/article/orion-are-metas-most-advanced-glasses-in-the-world-and-run-on-a-neural-interface/) on Wednesday, Meta announced that not only would it discontinue the 128GB version of the Meta Quest 3 VR headset, it would also drop the price of the [512GB version](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CD1JTBSC%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3e641f86-2249-4414-afe0-255dd0ef98df%7Cdtp&dtb=1) to $499\. That's a $150 discount on one of the best VR headsets on the market for both gaming and office productivity. We're expecting the price to drop any minute now at [Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CD1JTBSC%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3e641f86-2249-4414-afe0-255dd0ef98df%7Cdtp&dtb=1), [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmeta-quest-3-breakthrough-mixed-reality-512gb-white%2F6554912.p%3FskuId%3D6554912&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMeta-Quest-3-512GB-Breakthrough-Mixed-Reality-Powerful-Performance-Asgard-s-Wrath-2%2F3551794083&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp), and other retailers.

Along with 512GB of internal storage, the [Quest 3](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CD1JTBSC%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3e641f86-2249-4414-afe0-255dd0ef98df%7Cdtp&dtb=1) headset is more powerful than its predecessors, with double the graphics processing power, 4K+ display support, and louder 3D spatial audio. It also sports a slimmer, more refined design than the [Quest 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meta-quest-2-vs-meta-quest-3/), bringing it in line with the needs of anyone who prefers a virtual desktop for working from home and VR gamers looking for a lighter headset. The head strap and face cushion have also been redesigned to fit more comfortably than prescription glasses.

The integrated battery gives you just over 2 hours of use on a full charge, but with the included 18W adapter, you can stay plugged in for near-infinite use during a long day of meetings or do a quick recharge between VR games. The included controllers use haptic feedback for more immersive reactions to your in-program tasks, bringing your games closer to life. With support for over 600 types of games and apps, you'll never run out of ways to entertain yourself or integrate the Quest 3 into your home office. 

## When will this deal expire?

Meta announced the $150 price drop during their Meta Connect event on September 25, 2024 along with the discontinuation of the 128GB version of the headset. While this seems to be a permanent price drop for the Quest 3, there may be additional sales and limited-time promotions available from specific retailers.
