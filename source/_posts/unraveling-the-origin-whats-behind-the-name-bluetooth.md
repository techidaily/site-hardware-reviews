 Few technologies have become as embedded in our daily lives as Bluetooth. From smartphones and computers to TVs and speakers, this wireless technology has evolved far beyond hands-free headsets. But what's the deal with that odd name, and does it actually have anything to do with teeth?

##  A Brief History of Bluetooth

 The [beginnings of Bluetooth](https://article-posts.techidaily.com/2024-approved-insta-to-tik-integration-masterclass/) go back to 1989, when Nils Rydbeck, the CTO of Ericsson Mobile, started development on "short link" radio technology that would eventually become Bluetooth. The original purpose was specifically for wireless headsets.

 The next decade would be spent working on a viable solution. Things really heated up in 1998 when the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) was formed. It included Ericsson, IBM, Intel, Nokia, and Toshiba at first but quickly ramped up to around 4,000 members in just one year.

Ericsson T29

 It wasn't long before devices with Bluetooth started hitting the market. Bluetooth 1.0 was released in 1999, Harkening back to its original purpose, the very first Bluetooth device was a wireless headset. The first phone with Bluetooth was the Ericsson T36, but it wasn't until the [Ericsson T39](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson%5FT39) in 2001 that a phone with Bluetooth hit the market.

 Nowadays, the [Bluetooth SIG](https://www.bluetooth.com/) has over 30,000 members, and Bluetooth is found in far more devices than only wireless headsets and phones. Bluetooth 1.0 came out over 20 years ago, but the most recent version is only Bluetooth 5.4, released in February 2023.

##  Origin of the Bluetooth Name

 The origins of the Bluetooth name are a bit odd. It's a term that has become so common it's lost all meaning, but smashing the words "Blue" and "Tooth" together doesn't seem to make much sense in relation to wireless technology. In fact, it has nothing to do with that.

 The Bluetooth name came from Jim Kardach of Intel in 1997\. "Bluetooth" was the nickname for [King Harald Gormsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harald%5FBluetooth) of Denmark and Norway in the 10th century. Historians have guessed that the nickname came from a discolored tooth—imagine that. But how does that become the name of a wireless standard?

 Kardach said he chose the Bluetooth name because the king was "famous for uniting Scandinavia just as we intended to unite the PC and cellular industries with a short-range wireless link." It was originally going to be the codename, but here we are, nearly 30 years later, still saying "Bluetooth."

##  The Secret Meaning of the Bluetooth Logo

 The logo also has a surprising history behind it. You may think it's just a cool, stylized letter "B," but the shape is actually very intentional. Remember King Bluetooth? He did more than provide the name; he's also behind the logo.

 The Bluetooth "B" icon is a combination of the Nordic runes for the letters H and B—for Harald Bluetooth.

 Who knew we've all been saying the name of an ancient king and sporting his initials everywhere? Bluetooth is one of the most significant modern inventions—we use it all the time. Now, every time you do, you'll think about a guy with bad teeth from Scandanavia.
