Amazon Prime Day ended a few days ago, but some deals are still live. Case in point: Lenovo's [twelfth-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-ThinkPad-Processor-Touchscreen-Performance%2Fdp%2FB0D1D5J1J1%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C408ceb0e-9705-48ca-b9c2-3ea71225f545%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is currently $1,498, which is 40% off the normal price. I went hands-on with this laptop earlier this year and praised it for its great hardware, nice display, and solid battery life. It's perfect for remote workers who need a dependable, high-performing device.

Thanks to its solid performance and portability, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon series is best suited for professionals. The model that's on sale has an Intel Ultra 7 165 vPro processor with 32GB of RAM, allowing for some impressive performance. You can multitask and run multiple apps without experiencing any annoying slowdown. The high amount of memory also supports fast boot-up times and internet browsing.

[Lenovo gen 12 ThinkPad X1 Carbon for $1,500 (save $988) $3,459 at Lenovo](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flenovo.vzew.net%2Fc%2F159047%2F797408%2F3808%3Fprodsku%3D21KC000MUS%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.lenovo.com%252Fus%252Fen%252Fp%252Flaptops%252Fthinkpad%252Fthinkpadx1%252Fthinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-12-14-inch-intel%252F21kc000mus%26intsrc%3DCATF%5F5733&publisher%5Fslug=zdnet&article%5Fname=the%20lenovo%20laptop%20i%20recommend%20for%20hybrid%20workers%20is%20still%20%241%2C000%20off&article%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Farticle%2Fthe-lenovo-laptop-i-recommend-for-hybrid-workers-is-still-1000-off%2F&exclusive=1&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)

Another defining feature of this series is its lightweight design. The 12th Gen model weighs a diminutive 2.41 pounds and measures 12.31 x 8.45 x 0.59 inches. It also comes with a compact 14-inch touchscreen. 

Lenovo compensates for the small size by giving the screen a resolution of 1,920 x 1,200 pixels. The bezels on this laptop are noticeably thin, resulting in a surprisingly wide display. In fact, they're so thin that the manufacturer had to place the webcam inside a lip jutting out the top of the laptop.

Pro users will appreciate the full HD webcam, dual microphones, and stereo speaker array, allowing good video conferencing capabilities. Of course, I have to mention the keyboard, which I found particularly comfortable. Each key is covered in a matte-like material that is smooth to the touch. It may seem strange that I praise the keyboard, but as someone who writes for hours nonstop, having a design like this that alleviates stress means a lot. 

This laptop isn't solely for business professionals, though. It's well-rounded enough for various use cases, but it has lacks the features that a MacBook or an Asus gaming laptop has. It's a simple, easy-to-use machine with the strength to handle tough workloads.

Right now is the best time to buy the [Lenovo Gen 12 ThinkPad X1 Carbon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-ThinkPad-Processor-Touchscreen-Performance%2Fdp%2FB0D1D5J1J1%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C408ceb0e-9705-48ca-b9c2-3ea71225f545%7Cdtp&dtb=1) since it's currently on sale at Amazon for $1,498 which is a little over $1,000 off the original price. I should also mention that there is a variant of the laptop with a 2.8K OLED display, which is the model [I tested back in February](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-thinkpad-i-recommend-for-hybrid-workers-is-not-lenovos-newest-model/). The [OLED version](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-ThinkPad-Processor-Touchscreen-Performance%2Fdp%2FB0D5SNKGZ4%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C408ceb0e-9705-48ca-b9c2-3ea71225f545%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is much more expensive, but I do recommend it as an alternative if you can afford it.
