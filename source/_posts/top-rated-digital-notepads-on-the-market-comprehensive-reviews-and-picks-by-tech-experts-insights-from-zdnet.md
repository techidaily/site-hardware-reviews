## Top-Ranking Digital Notebooks of the Year: Comprehensive Expert Reviews & Comparisons - Featured

Despite the convenience of being able to plan smarter with technology, sometimes the act of writing down your [to-do lists](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-google-keep-and-how-to-use-it-as-your-virtual-to-do-list-maker/), [class notes](https://www.zdnet.com/education/business-management/how-to-use-your-google-drive-as-a-virtual-backpack/), and random reminders with a pen in a notebook is a more satisfying and productive approach. [Studies actually show](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2414241-writing-things-down-may-help-you-remember-information-more-than-typing/) that physically writing things down helps you remember more information than typing does.

## Boox Note Air 3 C

### Best smart notebook overall

Based on my hands-on experience with the Boox Note Air 3 C, it is the best smart notebook I have tried. While it doesn't have as crisp a color display as a traditional tablet like an [iPad](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/), this tablet's purpose is for note-taking, and it does an excellent job. 

It has all the best features of the best apps, like templates, audio recording, color-coding, inserting links and attachments to notes, and more. Plus, built-in artificial intelligence allows for text recognition, shape perfection, and a strikethrough erase feature that makes erasing much easier.

**Review: [The best E Ink tablet I've tested is not by ReMarkable or Kindle](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-e-ink-tablet-ive-tested-is-not-by-remarkable-or-kindle/)**

Some of its standout features enhance your productivity, like the split screen feature that allows you to switch between two different apps, so you can take notes on one side while reading an article on the other. 

In addition, if you need to use this tablet for work or school, you can easily send files to the tablet from your computer or smartphone using BOOXdrop. It takes mere seconds, and you can easily annotate PDFs and other Word documents. One [Reddit user noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/eink/comments/18j73er/how%5Fis%5Fthe%5Fboox%5Fnote%5Fair%5F3%5Fc/) that the tablet is outstanding in terms of PDF files. 

**Boox Note Air 3 C tech specs:** **Colors:** Black | **Storage**: 64GB | **Display**: 10.3-inch Kaleido 3 display, 1240 x 930 (150 PPI) for color and 2480 x 1860 (300 PPI) for black and white | **Connectivity**: Wi-Fi (2.4GHz + 5GHz) + BT 5.0

Pros 
* Transfers notes from book to app
* Different page styles allow for different uses

Cons

## Rocketbook Fusion Smart Notebook

### Best budget smart notebook

The Rocketbook Fusion Smart Notebook has versatile page and template options for only $40\. The notebook's synthetic paper allows you to write with the included Pilot FriXion pen, then wipe the page clean with a damp cloth to reuse it repeatedly.

In addition, you can save your pages to the Rocketbook app's cloud by tapping your pen on the icon at the bottom of the page to make them easy to find later.

I have gone hands-on with the Rocketbook Fusion, and it scratches that itch of satisfaction when hand-writing notes/to-do lists while also letting me check those lists via the app when I'm out and about. I also appreciated the different page styles, such as weekly and monthly planners, goal setting, task trackers, an ideas page, dot grids, and lined pages, so I could carry around one notebook instead of three. 

Amazon customers who have bought and reviewed this smart notebook also agree that the Rocketbook Fusion's ease of use, quality, organization, performance, and writing experience make it a great budget option. 

**Rocketbook Fusion features: Color options:** Nine | **Pages:** 42 | **Page styles:** Seven

## Kindle Scribe

### Best smart notebook for reading

The Kindle Scribe is the perfect example of a smart notebook that doubles as a tablet. It has the same functions you've come to know and love in a [Kindle](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-kindle/), like a 300ppi glare-free screen, weeks of battery life, and adjustable warm light. It's also compatible with Amazon's Basic or Premium Pen, so you can take handwritten notes or underline important quotations within the book you're reading. 

Your notes are automatically organized in one place for every book so that you can browse, review, and export them via email. The Kindle Scribe also comes with preset templates to help you create notebooks, journals, and lists, and you can create sticky notes in Microsoft Word and other compatible Word documents. 

**Read the review:** **[Amazon Kindle Scribe review: 7 ways it could be even more remarkable](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-kindle-scribe-review/)**

ZDNET's Matthew Miller said the Scribe has "made paper and pen notes obsolete for me." "While I have various other tablets, I've yet to find a pairing that feels natural, both in hardware and software, and often end up rarely ever using the stylus that they support," he wrote. "Also, I love that I can highlight text, make notes, and even sign documents with a signature that doesn't look like that of a two-year-old with the Scribe."

In addition, the Kindle Scribe comes with the Basic pen, but for the more advanced features like a dedicated eraser and the shortcut button, you'll need the premium pen, which costs $30 extra. Overall, 93% of customers who have bought the Kindle Scribe at Best Buy said they would recommend it.

**Kindle Scribe features: Colors:** Black with colored folios | **Storage:** 16GB/32GB, or 64GB | **Display:** 10.2-inch display with 300ppi, 16-level grayscale | **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity

### Best stylish smart notebook

If you appreciate the look and feel of Moleskine notebooks, then the company's Pen+ Smart Writing set could be the right smart notebook for you. The notebook features the signature dotted Moleskine page in a "paper tablet" format, so the pages are tucked in between a sturdy tablet-like design. Ncoded technology is embedded within each page, which enables the accompanying smart pen to recognize where it is within the notebook and to transfer all your freehand notes from page to screen in real time.

You can upload or share your notes digitally through the Moleskine Notes app and share them to Google Drive or Evernote. In addition, you can use the pen to record audio that lines up with what you've written, creating a multimedia note-taking experience.

**Read the review: [Moleskine Pen+ Ellipse: Smart note-taking cuts out digital distractions](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/work-life/moleskine-pen-ellipse-smart-note-taking-cuts-out-digital-distractions/)**

ZDNET put the Moleskine Pen+ to the test and particularly appreciated the replay option, which allows you to re-run how your notes came together. **"**This might not seem very useful for simple note-taking," Steve Ranger, who wrote the review, said, "but if you are drawing or brainstorming, it's really quite handy to see how an image or a set of ideas come together." 

We thought that artists, in particular, may find playback useful to see how their drawing process evolved. Customers who have bought the Moleskine agree, saying it's great for sketching, but cautions that the transcription process is a little slow. 

**Moleskine Pen+ features:** **Color options:** black | **Pages:** 176 | **Page styles:** ruled and dot grid

### Best smart notebook splurge

Those diligent note-takers looking to really splurge on a smart reusable notebook should consider the reMarkable 2\. This notebook is more of a [large-screen tablet](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-large-tablet/) with a low-latency E-Ink writing experience that makes you feel like you're writing on paper rather than on a tablet screen. In addition, with reMarkable's cloud app called Connect, you get access to standout features like screen share, handwriting conversion, unlimited cloud storage, and more.

**Read the review:** **[reMarkable 2 E-Ink tablet: Superb for on-screen writing, but key features are still missing](https://www.zdnet.com/product/remarkable-2/)**

ZDNET contributor Sandra Vogel was impressed with how it felt writing in the notebook. "There's a 'gritty' feel to using the stylus on-screen that's not unlike writing on paper," she said. "Both styli support 4,096 pressure levels, and there are plenty of pen choices and ink thicknesses to select from."

The reMarkable 2 comes with the option of either the Marker or Marker Plus pen that doesn't need charging and has a built-in eraser (only in the Marker Plus). Customers rate this smart notebook a 4.6 out of 5, calling out its use as an organizational tool for students and professionals alike.

**reMarkable 2 features: Color options:** Black, blue, red, gray, and white | **Storage:** 8GB internal storage | **Pages:** Stores about 100,000 pages | **Resolution:** 1872 x 1404

## Is a smart notebook just a fancy way of saying tablet?

If you're on the fence about buying your first tablet:

1. **What exactly is a digital notebook?**  
The sole purpose of a smart notebook is exactly that, to digitize a normal notebook. A smart notebook will enhance your basic note-taking experience to another level with better handwriting integration and cloud services.
2. **Digital notebook vs tablet, what's the difference?**  
A tablet, usually runs on a mobile operating system and offers a wider range of functions such as browsing the web, multimedia, gaming, and other tasks. A digital notebook is more niche and designed specifically for note-taking and digital writing tasks.
3. **Is a digital notebook worth it?**  
You can find a digital notebook for well under $20, making it a pretty budget-friendly option for students or anyone looking to organize their notes without breaking the bank. But, if you like for all your devices to be consistent in terms of software, then you might be better off spending a little more for a tablet.

## Which smart notebook is right for you?

## Factors to consider when choosing the best smart notebook

When you're deciding which smart notebook to buy, think about the following important factors: 

* **Notebook feel:** Does the notebook have a traditional notebook feel? Does it have a resolution that makes it feel more like a tablet as opposed to a notebook, or an appropriate latency?
* **Storage capabilities:** While some of these smart notebooks use actual paper, others have digital storage options. I considered both page count and storage capacity so you have plenty of room to write notes.
* **Price:** Smart notebooks range in price points from $10 all the way up to $450\. The lower price points will get you real paper notebooks you can convert to digital notes, while the higher price points are more tablet-like notebooks.
* **Special features:** You may not need special features in a smart notebook, but they are nice to have. These include audio notes, page templates, cloud compatibility, etc.

## How we test tablet devices

A lot of these digital notebooks can also be categorized as tablets. When we test different kinds of tablets, we typically follow the same routine for each one to see which performs best when [tested in the real world](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/). 

* **Display**: We measure the brightness level in different lighting conditions and assess color accuracy. We also compare the display's performance with what the manufacturer promised, test the screen's responsiveness to touch, and assess the performance of any extra features, like a manufacturer's stylus.
* **Performance:** For real-world performance metrics, our reviewers measure how quickly the tablet reacts to input, assess game performance and frame rates, test how the tablet handles having multiple apps running simultaneously, measure the time it takes to launch apps, and even assess the tablet's temperature during intensive tasks.
* **Battery life**: We test different scenarios for battery life, including measuring how long the battery lasts while streaming, web browsing, using productivity apps, and playing games.

For a deeper look into our testing process, check out our comprehensive [tablet testing methodology](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-tablets-at-zdnet-in-2024/). 

## Frequently Asked Questions:

## What's the best smart pen for my electronic notebook?

Our best pick for smart pens would have to be the [Apple Pencil](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-pencil-pro-vs-apple-pencil-2/) for Apple devices (but those only work strictly with Apple). For Windows users, the Wacom Bamboo is the next best option. but, as a general rule of thumb, you should use the pen designed for your notebook for software compatibility and functionality purposes.

## Do they come with a smart pen or are those sold separate?

Most smart notebooks already include a smart pen, but it will also depend on the manufacturer and specific model. Smart notebooks such as reMarkable 2 and Wacom Bamboo Slate include the smart pen with their notebook. 

## Would I recommend a smart notebook for students?

Keeping your notes and reminders organized on a single device for school is the best way to improve your productivity in and outside of class. That is why we recommend all students look into our best list of smart notebooks and find which is right for their needs. The Boox is a great option since you can connect it to many third-party apps through the Android store and transfer any files onto it, like essays or notes from class.

## Do smart notebooks feel like paper?

That depends on the specific product. For example, Rocketbook's lineup of smart notebooks are made with real paper, as is the Moleskine smart notebook. However, other options like the Kindle Scribe and the ReMarkable 2 have low-latency, e-ink screens that feel paper-like, but you can still definitely tell they are more of a tablet than an actual notebook with paper. 

## Can you use an iPad as a smart notebook?

While you won't get the "feel" of real paper with an iPad, you can use an iPad as a way to take notes digitally, especially if you have a quality stylus like the Apple Pencil. iOS apps like Noteflow allow you to take notes, annotate PDFs, sketch and doodle, and more while syncing to the cloud.

## Are there alternative smart notebooks to consider?

I chose the best smart notebooks based on pricing, styling preferences, and purposes. If you want a few more choices, here are alternatives: 

[Best premium alternative reMarkable Paper Pro Professionals who are serious about digital note-taking should consider reMarkable's Paper Pro, which has a large, colored screen and a host of integrations for popular productivity software.
