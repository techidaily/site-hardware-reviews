The IFA trade show is taking place now in Berlin, unveiling many new devices to explore, especially in the smart home category. SharkNinja is one of the brands showcasing new tech at IFA, with two new vacuums that tout a nearly hands-free cleaning experience for the consumer.

The announcement includes the [Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum and mop](https://sharkclean.sjv.io/c/159047/476540/8359?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkclean.com%2FzidRV2820ZE&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) and the [Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty cordless vacuum](https://sharkclean.sjv.io/c/159047/476540/8359?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkclean.com%2Fproducts%2Fshark-cordless-powerdetect-clean-empty-system-zidIP3251&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp).

The PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum and mop is a self-cleaning, self-emptying robot with self-refilling capabilities for $999.99\. It has a NeverMiss feature, which detects dirt and stuck-on stains to perform targeted, thorough cleaning. It also uses EdgeDetect to clear debris from edges by blasting air to push debris from the edges and baseboards into the vacuum's cleaning path.

Shark claims this new robot vacuum can provide up to 30 days of hands-free cleaning, as this is how long the clean water in the dock can continuously refill the robot's tank. However, this will depend on your floor plan, the size of the areas to be cleaned, dirt level, and different floor types. The dock can also hold dust and debris for up to 60 days before emptying.

The company also says that this Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro 2-in-1 robot vacuum and mop features navigation abilities that are twice as accurate as those of the Shark ION. The robot can navigate obstacles and thresholds, mapping your home with 360° LiDAR and advanced 3D sensors.

The new Shark PowerDetect Clean & Empty cordless vacuum, available for $499.99, features up to 70 minutes of runtime to reach every corner of your home. Staying true to Shark's hands-free cleaning promise as best as a cordless vacuum can, you can set the PowerDetect Clean & Empty cordless vacuum on its charging station and automatically empty its dust canister. 

Shark measured automatic emptying to result in 150 times less dust exposure than manual emptying. The dock traps fine dust, debris, allergens, and odors, which is much better for those with dust allergies.

The cordless vacuum's nozzle also intelligently detects dirt and debris in both forward and backward strokes, so you can count on it to pick up crumbs or pet hair on any surface.
