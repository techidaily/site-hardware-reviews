It's capable of 4K resolution as long as your graphics card also supports UHD output, and it has a 240Hz refresh rate which is perfect for video editing and reviewing projects before rendering and exporting finalized files.

## When will this deal expire?

Best Buy hasn't indicated any definitive end-dates for the $500 discount on the Samsung Odyssey Neo G8 32-inch curved gaming monitor, but you won't want to wait around to take advantage of the sale. Samsung or Best Buy may only have a certain number of monitors available at this price, which means the discount may end when they have sold a certain amount. And if you prefer brick-and-mortar shopping, physical stores have very limited stock, and may sell out quickly.
