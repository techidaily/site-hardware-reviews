 A smartphone in your pocket all the time makes it easy to [record impressive videos](https://ios-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-9-mind-blowing-tricks-to-hatch-eggs-in-pokemon-go-without-walking-on-apple-iphone-14-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/) or simply [record your screen](https://unlock-android.techidaily.com/how-to-change-lock-screen-wallpaper-on-xiaomi-13t-by-drfone-android/). Historically, editing those videos on your Android phone hasn't been as easy, but that's not the case anymore. We'll show you how.

 Like many things in the Android world, you have many options for editing videos. For the majority of people, the best option is the one already installed on your device. Google Photos is a popular app that has video editing capabilities, as does Samsung's stock Gallery app. We'll cover both.

##  How to Edit Videos on Android

 Editing a video on an Android device is typically the [same as editing a photo](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-green-thumbs-up-the-best-farming-titles-for-group-playtime/)â€”open the video in Google Photos or the Samsung Gallery app and select the "Edit" button. From there, you'll have the ability to trim and cut the video.

###  How to Trim Videos with Google Photos

 One of the best options for editing videos on any Android device is the Google Photos app. If you don't have it already, you can easily install it from the [Google Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU220505/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos). To get started, open the app and select the video you'd like to trim or cut.

![Select a video.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-18-45.png) 

 Tap the video to bring up the controls and tap the "Edit" icon. 

![Tap the edit button.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-19-34.png) 

 You'll be greeted with a timeline view of the video with handles on both ends. Drag the handles to adjust the length of the video.

 Google Photos does not support removing chunks from the middle of the video.

![Trim the video with handles.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-23-49.png) 

 When you're happy with your edits, tap "Save Copy" to apply the changes. 

![Tap "Save Copy."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-24-32.png) 

 That's all there is to it! The original video remains in its original unedited state.

###  How to Trim Videos with Samsung Gallery

 Samsung Galaxy devices have a stock "Gallery" app with some surprisingly good editing tools. Find the app on your home screen or app drawer and open it. 

![Open the "Gallery" app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-36-13.png) 

 Find the video you'd like to edit and select it. 

![Select a video.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-36-55.png) 

 Tap the pencil icon in the bottom bar to open the editing tools. 

![Tap the pencil icon.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-37-37.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 You'll see a timeline view of the video with handles on both ends. Use your finger to drag the handles to adjust the length of the video.

 Samsung Gallery can't remove chunks from the middle of the video.

![Use the handles to trim.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-39-12.png) 

 When you're done, tap "Save" in the top right to overwrite the video, or select "Save as Copy" from the three-dot menu in the bottom right. 

![Tap "Save" or "Save Copy."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2022-05-25_14-40-10.png)

##  How to Crop a Video on Android

 You might think of cropping as only a tool for photos, but it's also [possible to do with videos](https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-generate-hits-adobe-made-memes/) in nearly the exact same way with Google Photos or the Samsung Gallery app.

##  How to Rotate a Video on Android

 If you accidentally record a video in the unintended orientation, you can easily [rotate the video](https://common-error.techidaily.com/how-to-address-the-absence-of-an-audio-hardware-device-on-your-windows-pc/)â€”just like you would with a photoâ€”in Google Photos or the Samsung Gallery app.

###  How to Rotate Videos with Google Photos

 Download and install the [Google Photos app](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU220505/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.photos) if you don't already have it installed on your Android device. Next, find the video that you'd like to rotate. 

![Select a video.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2022-08-16_13-32-20.jpg)

![Tap "Edit."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2022-08-16_13-33-33.jpg)

![Select "Crop."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2022-08-16_13-34-11.jpg) 

 Now tap the rotate icon until the video is in your desired orientation. You can also drag your finger along the scale above the icon if you'd like more control over the rotation angle.

 It's as simple as thatâ€”the new video will be saved in your gallery!

##  How to Compress a Video on Android

 Unfortunately, it's not possible to compress videos with the built-in Gallery apps on the majority of Android devices. We'll need to [use a third-party app to do it](https://fox-that.techidaily.com/unstuck-from-a-dead-iphone-heres-how-no-physical-buttons-needed/), and, sadly, many of the apps that can accomplish this are riddled with ads and in-app purchases.

 We'll be using a free app called "[Video Compressor-Video to MP4](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU220505/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bdroid.videocompressorandconverter)." While it does have ads, there are no in-app purchases and you only need to grant permission to access your media files. As of June 2023, it has over one million downloads and a 4.2/5 rating.

 First, download the app from the [Play Store](https://redirect.viglink.com/?key=e7eab128eb8d1c53e14db14f4c632447&u=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.bdroid.videocompressorandconverter&cuid=xid:fr1686579075aab) and open it. 

![Open the app from the Play Store.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-06_17-03-01.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Next, tap the "Compress" button in the app. 

![Tap "Compress."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-06_17-03-29.jpg) 

 You'll need to grant the app permission to access the files on your device. Tap "Allow." 

![Tap "Allow" to grant permission.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-06_17-03-57.jpg) 

 Choose a video from the file browser. 

![Choose a video.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/2022-07-06_17-04-40.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Now you can choose the resolution of the video you'd like. The app shows the percentage of which the file size will be shrunk. Tap "Save" in the top right when you're ready.

 The video will be compressed and you can tap "Done" when it's finished. You'll probably need to skip an ad first.

 That's all there is to it! You can find the newly compressed video in your file manager under the "Video Compress and Convert" folder. This is a great trick for [sending videos to other devices](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-innovative-approach-to-hdr-portraiture-excellence/). The smaller file size allows for quicker transfers.

 KineMaster has been around for a long time, and it's still an excellent choice for video editing. It has many of the powerful video editing tools you might find on a desktop-class app, such as multiple layers, chroma key, transitions, and audio filters. You can try it out for free, then it's $4.99 per month after the trial.

###  Adobe Premiere Rush

![Adobe Premier Rush](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-07-28_17-19-47.png) 

 You probably know the name "Adobe" if you do any sort of photo or video editing. Premiere Rush is the company's mobile video editing appâ€”a lightweight spin-off of [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html?clickref=1011lwQZaX7C&mv=affiliate&mv2=pz&as%5Fcamptype=&as%5Fchannel=affiliate&as%5Fsource=partnerize&as%5Fcampaign=howtogeek). The simplified interface has a multi-track timeline with features such as color grading, text, transitions, and some simple motion graphic templates. Rush is included with an [Adobe Creative Cloud subscription.](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-prime-steadicam-devices-for-drones-in-filmmaking/)

 Video editing is typically much easier to do [on a PC](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/easy-steps-for-designing-podcast-rss-structure/) or [tablet](https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-flavor-of-fun-explore-the-10-top-themes-at-betterdiscord/), but sometimes you need to do it on the only device you have at the timeâ€”your phone. It's nice to at least have the option to do some lightweight editing on the go.
