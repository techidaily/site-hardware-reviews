## 1. 'Dual-Mouse Mastery: My Top Tech Upgrade of the Year'

### Key Takeaways

* My Logitech MX Master 3S is super comfortable thanks to its size, shape, weight, and quiet clicks, making it ideal for productivity.
* The mouse is not great for playing games that include aiming, though, which is why I always keep a Logitech G305 close and use it whenever I game.
* Rocking a dual mouse setup allows for seamless transitions between ergonomic comfort and gaming precision, offering the best of both worlds.

 After almost two decades of using gaming mice, I switched to an ergonomic mouse about a month ago. The move is already paying dividends because my new Logitech MX Master 3S is super comfortable to use, but I still decided to keep my Logitech G305 and switch to a dual mouse setup. Here’s why.

## [The Logitech MX Master 3S](https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/156932/1949464/8585?subId1=htgmxmaster3smouse&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Fmx-master-3s.910-006557.html) Is So Much More Comfortable Than My Gaming Mouse

 The [Logitech MX Master 3S](https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-7-ways-to-lock-apps-on-iphone-12-pro-and-ipad-securely-drfone-by-drfone-ios/) is a fantastic mouse for productivity and daily usage that doesn’t include gaming. Its size and shape fit my hand perfectly, and the rubberized coating feels great to the touch. After using it for about a month, I can say that this is the most comfortable mouse I’ve used to date.

 I had some issues moving away from the claw grip I used to hold my mice with for almost two decades. While I still catch myself on occasion claw-gripping the MX Master 3S, I hold it as supposed to most of the time, which has led to feeling less strain in my right wrist compared to using the G305 24/7.

 While I don’t like heft in my gaming mice (the reason why I opted for the MX Master 3S instead of something like the [Logitech G502](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-salt-and-surge-2023s-best-surf-cam-tech-review/)), I do like the MX Master 3S’ heft when casually browsing the web or working, its weight stabilizing and slowing down mouse movements when steering the mouse left and right across the mouse mat instead of turning every mouse movement into a lighting fast flick, which happened with the G305.

##  I Also Love Its Quiet Clicks, Infinite Scroll, and a Bunch of Programmable Buttons

 But the perfect size, shape, and weight aren’t the only things I love about the MX Master 3S. While its quiet clicks didn’t work for me the first couple of days of owning it (they felt quite mushy compared to the highly tactile and loud clicks on the G305), I’ve gotten used to them since then and have ended up loving them.

 After you get used to the lack of any sound, you find the previously mushy tactile feedback to be of just the right strength to clearly inform you that you just clicked the mouse, with the actuation force being just high enough to prevent accidental clicks.

 Then there’s the famous infinite scroll. When I picked up the G305 for the first time to play some games after using the MX Master 3S for a few days, its scroll wheel felt like something from the Dark Ages compared to the sci-fi feeling of the MX Master 3S’ scroll wheel.

 The scroll wheel's magnetic design results in superb tactility, and the SmartShift feature allows me to use it as a fidget toy when watching YouTube, which I ended up liking more than I should. In a nutshell, I adore the scroll wheel, and I can’t imagine using a mouse that doesn’t feature this kind of magnetic scroll wheel in the future.

[The Logitech MX Master 3S](https://logitech.cfzu.net/c/156932/1949464/8585?subId1=htgmxmaster3smouse&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Fmice%2Fmx-master-3s.910-006557.html) also has a ton of programmable buttons. I mapped [volume control](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/still-using-pattern-locks-with-nokia-c12-pro-tips-tricks-and-helpful-advice-by-drfone-android/) to the secondary scroll wheel, and I take screenshots with the button at the bottom of the thumb rest, which is pretty handy when having to capture a lot of screenshots for step-by-step guides.

 I also like the laser sensor, which, unlike the optical sensor in the G305, works perfectly on any surface. This makes my MX Master 3S a perfect rodent to use when streaming videos on my TV while chilling on the couch or watching YouTube/browsing the web while reclining in my computer chair and gliding the mouse over my T-shirt or thigh. Yes, I kind of look like the humans from Wall-E during those moments.

 Last but not least is the battery life. I’ve charged the mouse just once since I got it, and when I checked the Logi Options+ app just now, the battery still had a 45% charge left. That's phenomenal battery life if you ask me.

##  When I Want to Game, I Can Switch to My Logitech G305 in a Second

 Of course, the Logitech MX Master 3S isn't perfect—far from it. This is a [Bluetooth](https://techidaily.com/how-to-reset-honor-magic-5-pro-without-the-home-button-drfone-by-drfone-reset-android-reset-android/) mouse with the option to use a [Logi Bolt adapter](https://twitter-clips.techidaily.com/share-tweets-whatsapp-video-broadcasting-for-2024/), so while the performance is fine for regular usage, the high latency and lack of accuracy in games that require aiming are too high for comfort, at least for me.

 Then you’ve got the skates, which aren’t as slippery as those on the G305\. They create ever-so-slight resistance when moving the mouse, which I don’t mind when working or browsing the web, but that does annoy me when gaming.

 This is why my Logitech G305 hibernates under the monitor, ready to be used in less than five seconds. I just launch the game with the MX Master 3S, move it away, and pick up and turn on the G305 in less time than it takes the game to show its start screen.

 The relatively lightweight G305 feels even lighter after I've used the other mouse for days on end, making every gaming session even more enjoyable. I can flick the mouse left and right with almost zero effort, which is the main reason why I like my gaming mouse to be on the lighter side.

 Also, its fantastic optical sensor might behave erratically on any surface other than a mouse mat, but when on a mat, it works and feels staggeringly better than the one on the MX Master.

##  A Dual Mouse Setup Really Is the Best of Both Worlds

 At the end of the day, a dual mouse setup really gives me the best of both worlds. I can use my ergo mouse when working and using my PC for anything other than gaming. It’s super comfy, great for casual use, has a ton of programmable buttons, and the best scroll wheel I’ve ever used.

 But when I need the precision and lightweight design of a gaming mouse, I can switch to the G305 in a second and game with it like nothing happened. I love this dual mouse setup, and I don’t think I’ll ever switch back to using a single mouse again.
