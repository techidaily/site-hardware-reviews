## 2024'S Ultimate Guide to Premium Laptop Risers: Expert Picks

Unfortunately, even the [best laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/) aren't designed to curb the back and neck strain that can be caused by hours of hunching over your device. But you can overcome that problem with a simple solution: a laptop stand. Instead of placing your laptop on your desk, you put it on your laptop stand and adjust the height, so you can look straight ahead at the screen instead of bending your neck or hunching your shoulders. 

Some laptop stands are set in one place, while others are adjustable. They can raise your laptop from 4.7 to 20 inches off your desk. In addition to allowing you to work in an ergonomic manner, they can also give you additional real estate on your desk, which can be especially helpful if you have a small workspace. And, because your laptop is no longer sitting on a hard surface, it will get better airflow, which could keep it from overheating.

## Which is the right laptop stand for you?

Each laptop stand has a set of features and benefits to suit the needs of anyone using a laptop. Among the factors to consider are its weight and whether it can easily be folded down. This is important if you want to take it with you from your home to your office or other locations. 

You may want to alternate between sitting and standing at your desk. If that's the case, you'll need a laptop stand that can adjust to a height that will keep your laptop at eye level when you're standing. You may just want to raise your laptop off your desk or have a more permanent solution. This may entail freeing space underneath your laptop without needing to make further adjustments. Or you may need a laptop stand that's versatile enough for in-person presentations. Once you determine how you'll be using your laptop stand, you'll be able to make the best selection to suit your needs. 

| **Choose this laptop stand …**              | **If you want…**                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Upryze Ergonomic Laptop Stand               | The most versatility in your stand.                                                            |
| Mount-It! Laptop Desk Mount                 | A more permanent connection on your desk and you don't want to change its location frequently. |

## How did we choose these laptop stands?

In selecting the best laptop stands, we considered price in relation to the stand's value. We also looked for laptop stands that would match the varying ways you might want to use them, knowing that some people don't touch them once they're set up, while other people take them with them when they're traveling and still others need them for presentations.

* **Price:** We considered how the laptop stand was priced in regards to their features and specifications.
* **Functionality:** A good laptop stand offers portability, adjustability, and a lightweight feel. It should cater to your desired height and steadily hold your laptop in place.

## Are laptop stands worth it?

The quick answer is a resounding yes. Laptops are designed to be portable, but by their very design, they can create problems with your neck and back. A laptop stand can raise the height of the laptop's screen and keyboard so you can use it without causing neck or back strain. 

They can also free up space on your desk, which is particularly helpful if you have a small workspace. Additionally, depending on which laptop stand you choose, you may be able to adjust it to a standing height without having to buy an adjustable desk.

## Are laptop stands bad for the laptop?

No. Most laptop stands have padding on the platform, so the laptop doesn't get scratched. Most also have air vents, so the laptop doesn't overheat.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Are laptop stands good for posture?

Yes. When you're using a laptop more than six hours a day, you should try not to slump your back and you should keep your elbows bent at 90 degrees for comfort, according to [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/multimedia/back-pain/sls-20076817?s=3). If your laptop isn't at eye level you begin to slouch. With an adjustable laptop stand, you can set the height of your laptop so you can look directly at the screen without having to bend your neck taking the strain off your neck and back.

## Are laptop stands adjustable?

Although there are some laptop stands that are in a fixed position, with a set angle and height, more laptop stands are adjustable. This allows you to set the height and angle that's best for your height and the way you're using it.

## Are there alternative laptop stands worth considering?

A quick search for laptop stands on Amazon brings up more than 1,000 results. They range in price from $15 to $3,610\. In addition to Amazon, you'll find a variety of laptop stands at Walmart, Office Depot, Best Buy, Home Depot, Newegg, Ebay and other online stores. While the list of our favorite laptop stands is highly curated, it isn't comprehensive. Here are some other great laptop stands that will work for you.
