## IPad Pro versus MacBook Air Showdown: Determining Your Ideal Device with Expert Insights

![An iPad Pro next to a MacBook Air with a vs. down the middle](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/ead2295bea753d3b76d5c865067429031b6b173f/2024/09/12/259042ae-2e69-4ee7-9e09-802cac6105bf/your-paragraph-text.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Apple/ZDNET

With the launch of Apple's ARM-based processors in 2020, the company's devices have continued to become more powerful -- so much so that Apple's [iPad tablets](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence%2Fdp%2FB0D3J9XDMQ%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C67e51bf4-9878-48a4-abef-e9f462bda138%7Cdtp&dtb=1) have become known for their performance just as much as [MacBooks](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop%2Fdp%2FB0CX23V2ZK%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C67e51bf4-9878-48a4-abef-e9f462bda138%7Cdtp&dtb=1). 

**Also:** [**The best iPad models: Expert tested**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/)

Deciding between an iPad and a MacBook depends on what you need the device for and how much performance, storage, and capabilities you need for your workflow and tasks. 

Since there are many variations and generations of both the iPad and the MacBook, I compared the most recent models of the [iPad Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence%2Fdp%2FB0D3J9XDMQ%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C67e51bf4-9878-48a4-abef-e9f462bda138%7Cdtp&dtb=1) and the [MacBook Air](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop%2Fdp%2FB0CX23V2ZK%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C67e51bf4-9878-48a4-abef-e9f462bda138%7Cdtp&dtb=1) (since they are relatively the same size and weight and roughly have the same amount of computing power), so you can decide which Apple device best suits your needs.

### 1\. You want Apple's most efficient processor

Apple's M4 chip is only available in the [2024 iPad Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-iPad-Pro-11-Inch-Intelligence%2Fdp%2FB0D3J9XDMQ%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C67e51bf4-9878-48a4-abef-e9f462bda138%7Cdtp&dtb=1). This chip consists of a new 10-core GPU, next-generation machine learning accelerators to handle various tasks, and ProMotion technology, enabling variable screen refresh rates ranging from 10 to 120Hz.

A more efficient processor means the iPad speeds through app load times, 4K video exports, detecting and cropping subjects out of images, and more, making switching to an iPad-first workflow easier than ever. 

**Also:** [**I replaced my MacBook with an M4 iPad Pro and was less bothered than I expected**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-review/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-review/%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22I%20replaced%20my%20MacBook%20with%20an%20M4%20iPad%20Pro%20and%20was%20less%20bothered%20than%20I%20expected%22%7D)

### 2\. You draw or take notes using an Apple Pencil

For digital artists, drawing on a tablet with a stylus can be much easier than working on a computer or laptop. The iPad Pro supports the Apple Pencil Pro, which has a range of useful features for drawing, including a squeeze gesture for quick tool, color, and other changes, a gyroscope for precise control of pens and brush tools with a simple rotation, and custom haptic feedback that you can feel via a pulse. 

As ZDNET editor-in-chief Jason Hiner noted in his [hands-on review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-and-ipad-air-2024-buying-advice/), "The M4 OLED iPad Pro is a much easier sell for professional digital artists."

### 3\. You need something portable for on-the-go tasks

Tablets are naturally smaller and easier to carry than laptops, making the iPad Pro great for photo editing, note-taking, web browsing, and even streaming movies. The 11-inch iPad Pro weighs less than a pound, compared to the MacBook Air's 2.7 or 3.3 pounds. 

The iPad Pro is a great portable option for students to take notes for classes, take Zoom calls, and even write essays with the addition of the newly revamped [Magic Keyboard](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMWR03LL%2FA%2Fmagic-keyboard-for-ipad-pro-11%25E2%2580%2591inch-m4-us-english-white&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). The keyboard features a thinner and lighter design, a larger trackpad, and a new row of function keys, making the keyboard case more essential than ever for the full iPad experience.

### 1\. You need a reliable device for work tasks

While the iPad Pro is touted as a "laptop replacement," it still can't quite live up to a physical laptop in terms of performing certain tasks for business users. For example, if you are managing and sharing Google Docs, hosting a Zoom meeting, or running a presentation, you'll need a capable laptop like the [MacBook Air](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-2024-MacBook-13-inch-Laptop%2Fdp%2FB0CX23V2ZK%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C67e51bf4-9878-48a4-abef-e9f462bda138%7Cdtp&dtb=1). 

**Also:** [**M3 MacBook Air review: Apple's AI computer for the masses has arrived**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m3-macbook-air-review/#link=%7B%22role%22:%22standard%22,%22href%22:%22https://www.zdnet.com/article/m3-macbook-air-review/%22,%22target%22:%22%5Fblank%22,%22absolute%22:%22%22,%22linkText%22:%22M3%20MacBook%20Air%20review:%20Apple's%20AI%20computer%20for%20the%20masses%20has%20arrived%22%7D)

The MacBook Air also has more internal storage options than the iPad Pro: 8GB, 16GB, or 24GB, giving you more storage space options. However, keep in mind that higher storage specs will cost you more (between $200-$400 more).

### 2\. You use AI applications

The MacBook Air is compatible with AI features and applications, thanks to its M3 processor. This allows you to better handle AI workloads, like summarizing longer text, browsing the web with a specific focus, generating Excel formulas, writing code, making graphs and charts, and more.

MacOS is getting an [Apple Intelligence](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-intelligence-arrives-next-month-6-ai-upgrades-iphone-users-can-expect-first/) update in September 2024, so AI will be even more seamlessly involved in the MacBook Air experience, with everything from Siri to creating unique images. Plus, the M3 chip means the MacBook Air is future-proofed for the inevitable deluge of AI applications coming.

### 3\. You like the option of using external displays

Some people can work on one screen, but many prefer a two-screen display to optimize their workflow. With the MacBook Air, you can connect up to two external monitors with the lid closed, attach a mouse and keyboard, and use it like a bigger desktop setup. (The iPad Pro can only be used as a second display for a Mac or Windows PC, meaning the tablet itself acts as the external display.)

You can access everything on your MacBook Air on a larger display setup, allowing for improved multitasking, increased productivity, and an overall more comfortable viewing experience.
