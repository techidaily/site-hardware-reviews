Satechi USB-C Multimedia Adapter M1\. 

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

I know we're moving more and more to a wireless world, but I still [need my ports](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/need-more-ports-this-tiny-lightweight-premium-quality-dock-delivers/). 

[USB-C](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/using-the-wrong-usb-c-cable-can-damage-your-tech-heres-how-to-avoid-that/), HDMI, even a few USB-A ports are handy.

This is why, as much as I love my new [M2-powered iPad Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-Wi-Fi-128GB%2Fdp%2FB0BJLF2BRM%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C13cb2292-df0a-4110-9dfd-b81e3bb2225e%7Cdtp&dtb=1), I find that single USB-C port really restrictive.

Until now.

**Also:** [**Using the wrong USB-C cable can damage your tech. How to avoid that**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/using-the-wrong-usb-c-cable-can-damage-your-tech-heres-how-to-avoid-that/)

Enter into the equation the [Satechi USB-C Multimedia Adapter M1](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=4338022&m=98197&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fancheer.sjv.io%2Fy96bgp) (don't let that M1 fool you, this works just as well on M2 hardware).

The USB-C Multimedia Adapter M1 features dual 4K HDMI display ports (60Hz/30Hz), a USB-C port for charging, a separate USB-C data port (this is so useful when [I'm editing drone footage on my iPad Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-2022-m2-apple-ipad-pro-is-my-drone-copilot/)), and two extra USB-A 3.0 data ports. And all this from a single USB-C connection. 

Ports galore.

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

As is the case with all Satechi products, this adapter is not only functional but beautiful. Packaged in a brushed aluminum housing, it matches the fit, finish, and feel of Apple products.

**Also:** [**Don't waste your money on these Apple products**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dont-waste-your-money-on-these-apple-products-december-2022-edition/)

And given that it's pretty compact -- 12 x 6 x 1.8 cm, and weighing in at 140 g -- it's small enough to slip into a pocket or your iPad or laptop bag.

Compact, yet powerful.

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

As with almost all Satechi products, I don't have a bad thing to say about the USB-C Multimedia Adapter M1\. I suppose if pushed for a tweak, I do sometimes feel like the cable on the adapter is a bit on the small side, and wish that it was detachable. But I also know that if it was detachable, I'd detach it, use it somewhere else, and not have it when I needed it.

**Also:** [**The 2022 M2 Apple iPad Pro is my (drone) copilot**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-2022-m2-apple-ipad-pro-is-my-drone-copilot/)

And if it were longer, it would add to the bulk and clutter.

No, the [Satechi USB-C Multimedia Adapter M1](https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=999&u=4338022&m=98197&afftrack=techidaily&urllink=https%3A%2F%2Fancheer.sjv.io%2Fy96bgp) is as close to perfection as an adapter can be.
