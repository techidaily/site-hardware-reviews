These days, with cyberattacks increasing in scope and complexity, we need professional, ethical hackers to help protect the day-to-day services we all use.

## How did we choose these hacker gift ideas?

It can be a challenge to find specialist gifts -- whether the field you're interested in is cybersecurity or otherwise -- so we examined products that would appeal to the widest customer base available. Or, at the least, products that will keep the hackers in your life busy, learning, and out of mischief. 

However, not every gift has to have a hands-on educational purpose in mind, so we've also included interesting reads on the industry.

## Is hacking illegal?

There is a misconception that all hacking is illegal. However, hacking is simply identifying weaknesses in services or a device -- whether it is a PC, smartphone, or another physical object -- and software, including apps, and attempting to exploit them.

This could include a computer network, old tech equipment, or a website's backend control system. 

Hacking, in itself, doesn't automatically mean unauthorized entry. There are companies out there that ask for ethical hackers to test their software for weaknesses and will reward them financially for their findings.

It is only when a hacker uses their skills for unauthorized and criminal purposes, theft, or destruction that it becomes illegal. This could include breaking into a network to deploy malware or stealing confidential information.

## What types of ethical hackers are out there?

Ethical hackers are individuals who go into the cybersecurity field for 'white hat' purposes and to defend against cybercriminals. 

Job roles include penetration testers who try to find weaknesses in software and networks; bug bounty hunters who privately disclose vulnerabilities to companies; consultants, network defense experts, OSINT intelligence and investigation experts, and more. 

## I want to learn about hacking but where do I start?

If you're interested in learning how to hack -- and stay within the realms of the law while you're doing so -- you can begin by checking out free resources including YouTube and Coursera. Alternatively, you can begin by earning a few certifications in the field.
