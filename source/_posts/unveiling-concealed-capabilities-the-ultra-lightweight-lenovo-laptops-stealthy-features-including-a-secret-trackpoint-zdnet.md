Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon on table

Amazon Prime Day is just a few days away, and I've been scouring Amazon for the best laptop deals. It took some time, but I found a great deal for Lenovo's [twelfth-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-ThinkPad-Processor-Touchscreen-Performance%2Fdp%2FB0D1D5J1J1%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C28a1a282-195c-4302-8cfb-f00b73c89e80%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon series is best suited for business professionals. Laptops in this group are well known for their solid performance and portability. This model houses an Intel Ultra 7 165 vPro processor with 32GB of RAM. A configuration like this guarantees an impressive performance. You can multitask and run multiple apps without experiencing any annoying slowdown. Plus, the high amount of memory supports fast boot-up times and internet browsing.

[Lenovo gen 12 ThinkPad X1 Carbon for $1,500 (save $988) $1,798.68 at Lenovo](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flenovo.vzew.net%2Fc%2F159047%2F797408%2F3808%3Fprodsku%3D21KC000MUS%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.lenovo.com%252Fus%252Fen%252Fp%252Flaptops%252Fthinkpad%252Fthinkpadx1%252Fthinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-12-14-inch-intel%252F21kc000mus%26intsrc%3DCATF%5F5733&publisher%5Fslug=zdnet&article%5Fname=this%20lenovo%20business%20laptop%20is%20seeing%20a%20nearly%20%241%2C000%20discount%20on%20amazon%20ahead%20of%20october%20prime%20day&article%5Furl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zdnet.com%2Farticle%2Fthis-lenovo-business-laptop-is-seeing-a-nearly-1000-discount-on-amazon-ahead-of-october-prime-day%2F&exclusive=1&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp)

Another defining feature of this series is the lightweight design. The 12th Gen model weighs a measly 2.41 pounds and measures 12.31 x 8.45 x 0.59 inches. Looking at those dimensions, you'll notice the laptop is pretty compact. It sports a 14-inch touchscreen, which may disappoint people who prefer larger displays. However, Lenovo makes for the small size by giving the screen a resolution of 1,920 x 1,200 pixels. The result is a surprisingly wide screen. If you look closely at the images, the bezels are noticeably thin. They're so thin that Lenovo had to place the webcam inside a lip at the bottom of the laptop.

Pro users will appreciate the full HD webcam, dual microphones, and stereo speaker array, which allow you to enjoy immersive video conferences on the go. Of course, I can't forget to mention the very comfortable keyboard. Each key is covered in a matte-like material that is smooth to the touch. The buttons all have a slight indentation guiding your fingers to the center.

It may seem strange that I praise the keyboard, but as someone who writes for hours nonstop, having features that alleviate stress means a lot. That is exactly what the matte-coating and indentation do.

This laptop isn't solely for business professionals. Everybody can enjoy the device; however, it doesn't have any of the flashy features that a MacBook or an Asus gaming laptop has. It's a simple, easy-to-use machine with the strength to handle tough workloads.

Right now is the best time to buy this device. The [Lenovo Gen 12 ThinkPad X1 Carbon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-ThinkPad-Processor-Touchscreen-Performance%2Fdp%2FB0D1D5J1J1%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C28a1a282-195c-4302-8cfb-f00b73c89e80%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is currently on sale at Amazon for $1,500\. That is almost $1,000 off the original price. I should also mention that there is a variant of the laptop with a 2.8K OLED display, which is the model [I tested back in February](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-thinkpad-i-recommend-for-hybrid-workers-is-not-lenovos-newest-model/). The [OLED version](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-ThinkPad-Processor-Touchscreen-Performance%2Fdp%2FB0D5SNKGZ4%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C28a1a282-195c-4302-8cfb-f00b73c89e80%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is much more expensive, but I recommend it as an alternative if you can afford it.
