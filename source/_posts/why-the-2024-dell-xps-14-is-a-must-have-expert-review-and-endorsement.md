If you're already starting to stress about some of the logistics, don't worry -- there are things you can do and pack that make travel easier, less stressful, and combat some metaphorical turbulence. For example, you can slip an [AirTag](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MX542AM-A-AirTag-Pack%2Fdp%2FB0932QJ2JZ%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C27ef7fe5-175f-48d8-839b-3f3ecd2fac28%7Cdtp&dtb=1) into your bag to at least know the whereabouts of "lost" luggage.

* Compatible with iOS and Android devices
* USB-A and USB-C charging ports

Cons

* Pricey

## Anker 747 GaNPrime 150W charger

### Best travel tech gadget overall

**Anker 747 GaNPrime charger features:** 3 USB-C ports and 1 USB-A port | Can charge 2 laptops at once | Can charge up to 4 devices at once | 38% smaller than Apple's 140W charger, but packs in 10 more Watts (150W)

When you're traveling, it's important to keep all your devices powered and ready to go. Has anyone else ever had their phone die _just_ as you're scanning your mobile boarding pass? To avoid that embarrassment, world traveler [Nick Yiu](https://www.youtube.com/@nicholasyiu1) is saving up for the Anker 747 charger to power all his devices for the five flights he has coming up. Even though the brick is smaller than a standard Mac charger from Apple, it offers three USB-C style ports, a traditional USB-A port, and all at a whopping 150W total output. To put it in perspective, it's powerful enough to charge two laptops in a short amount of time. 

"This would replace the need to carry any additional power bricks, so you just need this one alone," said Yiu. 

The 747 also employs Anker's [GaNPrime technology](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-gallium-nitride-gan-next-generation-charging-technology/), which is a faster, more powerful, and even more sustainable semiconductor than traditional silicon chargers. Anker's ActiveShield 2.0 technology also monitors temperature throughout the day and makes the appropriate power output adjustments, safeguarding connected devices. For these reasons and more, this charger is even essential for ZDNET contributor [Jason Cipriani](https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-are-my-5-must-have-devices-for-work-travel-now/) when he travels for work. 

However, Cipriani points out that while the brick is compact, it is heavy, "falling out of most outlets, which is why Anker includes a plate that fits around the adapter and has a bunch of small suction cups to hold it against the wall." Aside from its density, the only other downside of the 747 power brick is the $110 price tag. However, when you factor in its adaptability and power, you're really paying for multiple charges rolled into one.

Pros 
* Lightweight
* 5 total USB ports
* Can use adapter for almost any country
* Enough wattage to charge a laptop

Cons 
* Only compatible for 100V to 250V devices
* Max of 15W on USB-C

## Tessan International Plug Adapter

### Best adapter for international travel

**Tessan International Plug Adapter features:** 2 USB-A ports (12W) | 3 USB-C ports (15W) | 4 different built-in plugs, which covers over 150 countries | 6 in 1 travel adapter outlet 

[The New York Times' recent daily crossword](https://dazepuzzle.com/annoying-thing-to-forget-to-pack-for-a-trip-crossword-clue-nyt/) acknowledged that the most "annoying thing" you can forget to pack for a trip is, by far, a charger. Even more frustrating is remembering a charger, and don't forget that if you're traveling abroad, there's a high likelihood your charger won't work. Enter the Tessan International Plug Adapter. This compact tool has four different built-in plug types, which covers over 150 countries, and also includes a universal AC outlet that can convert plugs from the ES, EU, UK, and AU to fit your chargers' socket. 

Featuring five total USB ports, three of which are USB-C, this can also be used both internationally and domestically as a multi-charging brick. In fact, the executive editor of The Points Guy, [Scott Mayerowitz](https://thepointsguy.com/author/smayerowitz/), says this is one of his biggest tricks since they easily plug into airplane outlets and can be a one-stop, compact shop to keep track of different cords. 

This is especially a good option if you don't want the heavy price tag or physical weight of something like the Anker 747\. It may not be as fast, but it's definitely efficient and price-conscious. However, keep in mind that devices requiring a higher voltage, such as a [hair dryer](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fdyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-vinca-blue-rose%2F6514439.p%3Ftag%3Dzdnet-deals-20), are only compatible with devices in the 150V-250V range.

## Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones

### Best travel headphones

**Sony WH-1000XM5** **headphone features:** Over ear, closed back | Bluetooth 5.2 | USB-C charging port | Up to 30 hours of battery (3 hours on a 3-minute charge) | 4Hz-40,000Hz frequency response 

Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones are a cult classic. With market-leading active noise cancellation and up to 30 hours of battery, they've rightfully earned the top spot on our [best headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-headphones/) and [best noise-canceling headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-noise-canceling-headphones/) list and in Lonely Planet Managing Destination Editor Alex Howard's [favorite travel bag](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-backpack-zip?tag=zdnet-deals-20). 

"The drone of the engines disappears into a pleasant background hum, and you can focus on catching up with the Last of Us instead of the screaming baby a few rows over," Howard said. 

Excellent sound quality isn't their only travel perk; the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones include a folding design and compact carrying case, making them easy to take on the go for short and long trips alike.

Pros 
* Transparent and noise canceling quality is best in class
* Wireless charging
* Integrates Apple's FindMy system

Cons 
* Remain some of the most expensive earbuds on the market
* If you have multiple Apple devices, beware of connectivity chaos
* Not the greatest for non-iPhone users

Battery Life  Rated up to 6 hours

Noise Canceling  Yes (ANC)

Multipoint  No

Headphone Type  Wireless earbuds

Water-Resistant  Yes (IPX4 -- splash-proof)

## AirPods Pro 2

### Best travel earbuds

**Apple AirPods Pro 2 features:** 6-hour battery life and 30 hours in the case | IPX4 waterproof rating | 5.3 g each | Wireless charging | New Apple H2 chip 

Over-ear headphones are a powerful sound blocker, but they're not necessarily space-conscious. If you're not ready to sacrifice precious luggage real estate with headphones, no matter how compact or portable, a pair of pocket-sized noise-canceling earbuds can be just as effective. I personally never leave my apartment without my Apple AirPods Pro 2 or get on a plane without them. What I love about the second-gen AirPods is that they deliver outstanding sound quality in both [noise-canceling and transparent modes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACsbPIyr0NM). 

**Also:** [**Flying soon? Flighty is a must-have iOS app for air travel**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/flying-soon-flighty-is-a-must-have-ios-app-for-air-travel/)

Sure, it's great to block out the rattles of the subway car as I make my way to the airport or the crying baby on the plane, but it's also important to be aware when traveling. And with my AirPods, I can clearly hear the flight attendant announce which carousel my luggage has (hopefully) arrived at without having to pause Taylor Swift's "Welcome to New York" as I fly into the city, per Scott Mayerowitz's suggestion.

Plus, there's a built-in case speaker that makes it easy to ping your AirPods case if it's lost in the depths of your bag or waiting to be rescued from the airplane seatback pocket. Apple's FindMy feature also comes in handy to keep track of all Apple-associated devices when you're on the go, sending you a notification when one isn't on the move with you. The second-gen Pros also employ wireless charging, even via the Apple Watch charger, which may save you packing one less cable.

## iPad Pro

### Best travel tablet

**iPad Pro (2018) features:** M1 chip | 12.9 inch Liquid Retina XDR display | WiFi 6 connection available | 12MP Ultra-Wide camera | 4K video recording at 30 fps or 60 fps | Five microphones and four speakers | FaceID | USB-C charging port 

Speaking of Apple, Alex Howard relies on his iPad Pro for inflight entertainment. But his main pro tip is to upgrade to a bigger storage size to "accommodate extra seasons of your favorite TV show when Wi-Fi is spotty." 

While a few years old, the 2018 iPad Pro features Apple's fast-performing M1 chip, a 12.9 Liquid Retina HDR display that makes for sharp and vivid visuals, and 1600 nits at peak brightness. Plus, if you take Alex's suggestion and opt for more storage, you won't face much latency and can let the high-res graphics shine. 

At 22.26oz and around $480 at most retailers, you won't be adding too much weight to your travel gear or your wallet, especially compared to the[most recent iPad Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2022-review/) model. Additionally, the iPad Pro 2018 (3rd generation) is compatible with the more sleek, capless second-generation Apple Pencil, which simply attaches to the magnetic strip to [pair and charge](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-pair-and-charge-your-apple-pencil/). And if you're like me, it's great for [taking notes](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-note-taking-app-for-ipad/) that can even sync to and stay on your other devices while you're on the go. 

Of course, the iPad Pro 2018 also integrates Apple's FindMy system, making it easy to track and find as you destination hop.

## Duex Plus monitor

### Best travel monitor

**Duex Plus monitor features:** 13-inch display | Compatible with Mac and Windows laptops | Auto-Rotation display | Multi-device compatibility | 1.33 mm | USB-C plug-and-play 

Traveling doesn't mean you have to sacrifice work productivity. If you, like me and many other working professionals, rely on a monitor to multitask, the Duex Plus is a great portable option. Coming with four adhesive magnets, the monitor easily attaches to your laptop cover and flips out hassle-free. From there, it's as easy as connecting via USB-C to either your Mac or Windows laptop -- no extra HDMI cord is needed. 

[ZDNET's June Wan reviewed](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/this-flip-out-portable-monitor-is-my-productivity-secret-weapon/) the monitor and was not only impressed with the easy setup but also with its ability to enhance his workflow, from responding to Slack messages to video editing. 

What makes the Duex optimal for travel is its ability to slide in and out from the laptop lid and then just collapse and act as a makeshift case before you pack it away in your back. While there's no need to lug around an extra bag or pack the monitor as a new entity, it unsurprisingly does add some bulk to your laptop.

Pros 
* 360-degree footage
* Compact and rugged for adventurous travel
* User-friendly
* 2.29-inch display makes for an excellent viewfinder

Cons 
* Software support can be sluggish
* 360-footage requires a larger MicroSD card

## Insta360 X3

### Best action camera for travel

**Insta360 X3 features:** 180g | 2.29-inch touchscreen | ½" 48MP sensor | Up to 5.7K resolution | 1,800 mAh removable battery | USB-C or MicroSD connectivity | Waterproof up to 33ft 

The best part of traveling is making memories and capturing them. However, lugging around a big camera takes up space, adds weight, and places limits on capturing fun action shots. As of right now, travel buff Nick Yiu likes throwing in his tiny but mighty [GoPro](https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras?&&gclid=Cj0KCQjww4-hBhCtARIsAC9gR3b-5Occ1Knb7aHvOtmU6F9fFb5VQbAaqKJD11BbYQD-2ic%5FHZAdh60aAmZ9EALw%5FwcB&gclsrc=aw.ds) to take versatile footage but has his eye on the Insta360 X3 action camera. As the name suggests, the camera films at every angle and assures you won't miss a shot -- even if you're skydiving. 

ZDNET's June Wan [did have the chance to go hands-on](https://www.zdnet.com/article/insta360s-x3-review/) with the Insta360 X3, and his experience confirmed that it's worth a spot on Nick's packing list and our best travel tech list. 

"Whether you're a professional or a beginner, the X3 brings a lot to the table for all to play," said Wan. 

This third-generation action cam is the Insta360's most compact, refined design yet and, according to Wan, "the exterior is gilded with a rugged blend of rubber and texturized ridges which assures you that the X3 can hang in the toughest outings and/or within the slipperiest of fingers." 

Perfect for long adventures, the camera is also capable of lasting two to three days on one charge, limiting yet another device you have to charge on your trip. Additionally, Insta360 puts "art" in artificial intelligence, as June Wan puts it, packing a suite of photo editing AI features on the back and front end.

## Guide AI trip planner

### Best travel planner

**Guide features:** AI trip planning tool | AI chatbot to ask questions | Free | Can book hotels | Group planning

If you want to make your trip as seamless and efficient as possible, you need a trip planner. While not a tech gadget per se, a planner can help you stay organized before and during your trip, making travel much less stressful.   
Guide is an AI travel planning tool that helps you create personalized itineraries based on your trip preferences. (Full disclosure: It's also ZDNET's sister brand. It's currently in private beta, but you can join a wait list.) Once you create an account, you can input your travel details, and Guide will generate a customizable schedule for your desired trip, with hotel, restaurant, activity, and attraction suggestions. 

You can modify Guide's suggested itinerary to your liking by adding new activities and restaurants or by moving current suggestions around -- a feature ZDNET associate editor Gabriela Perez Jordan loves. In a recent trip, she used Guide to find the top activities and restaurants to visit in Austin, Texas. 

With Guide, you can also send your schedule to friends and family to assist in the trip-planning process, or you can use its chatbot to ask your most burning questions regarding your destination. While you currently can't book any flights, transportation, or restaurant reservations through Guide, you can book and find great hotel deals powered by Expedia.

## How did I choose these travel tech gadgets?

To compile my list and decide which travel tech was the best of the best, I turned to experts and enthusiasts. I consulted Nick Yiu, who took 15 flights in 2022, the executive editor of travel publication The Points Guy, [Scott Mayerowitz](https://thepointsguy.com/author/smayerowitz/), and Lonely Planet Destinations Managing Editor Alex Howard. As a frequent traveler myself, I also drew from my own experience and looked at products ZDNET has reviewed.   
Ultimately, I weighted the following aspects when curating this list: 

* **Design:** When selecting travel tech gadgets, portability and design were top of mind since you must always consider where you will store your devices during your trip. Most, if not all, of these devices are lightweight and compact, perfect to store in a purse, backpack, carry-on, or suitcase.
* **Durability:** No one likes to buy products that break at first use, which is why I only included items you could buy and count on their performance for years to come.
* **Price:** Useful travel gadgets don't have to be a hefty investment, especially when you have hotel, transportation, and flights to consider -- or, let's be real, you can easily forget the gadgets in a car or hotel. The devices on this list are top-quality devices that won't break the bank.
* **Functionality:** Traveling requires fitting all of your essentials in a tight, compact space. This means you should only take devices that advance common traveling components, such as charging your phone, tuning out noise on the plane, or storing and recording memories.

## What should I look for in a good piece of travel tech?

According to The Points Guy Executive Editor Scott Mayerowtiz, it's important to travel with tech that is lightweight, compact, and durable. 

"You might have to pay an extra $10 to $15, but it's well worth it to have the lightest device or the one with the battery that lasts that extra 20 to 30 minutes. It makes all the difference when you're on the road or in the air," he said. 

That said, it's also important not to get the most expensive item on the market, "How many chargers have you left in a hotel room when checking out in a rush?" joked Mayerowitz. "Maybe it doesn't have to be the 'best' product out there. Be mindful that things on the road get damaged." 

I considered Mayerowitzs' tips on what to look for when compiling this list -- making sure I talked to someone who had hands-on experience with every product and could vouch for it's quality.

## Is smart luggage worth it?

Smart luggage has been a hot-button item, but they don't necessarily make travel easier. If a smart suitcase has a lithium battery, you'll have to [remove it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/can-i-take-my-smart-suitcase-on-the-plane/)before even getting to the airport. However, certain smart suitcases, like the [Away](https://www.awaytravel.com/suitcases/carry-on?color=black&usb%5Fcharger=not%5Fincluded&gclid=Cj0KCQjww4-hBhCtARIsAC9gR3ZTB1BV7802IGAC15eaBJ-87lZnc7Pss0-o4NC1SPTMYHBoeXEEBUMaAnciEALw%5FwcB) suitcase, can be purchased without the lithium battery pack. 

## Are there alternative travel tech gadgets worth considering?

While deciding on the best products on the market, we tried to find the best options to throw in your luggage and make your next trip as stress-free, entertaining, and easy as possible. 

However, there are also other options worth considering, depending on your different preferences and how you like to spend your travel time. 

[Best AirPods Pro 2 alternative Samsung Galaxy Earbuds 2 Pro I love my AirPods Pro 2, but they're not the only Pro earbuds on the market with great sound quality and noise-canceling abilities. The Samsung Galaxy Earbuds 2 Pro work well with, but aren't limited to, other Samsung ecosystem devices.
