### Are there different laptop deals after Prime Day has ended?

Invite-only Prime deals -- or Lightning Deals -- may be different each day. Amazon [confirmed last month](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fpress.aboutamazon.com%2F2024%2F6%2Famazons-10th-prime-day-event-returns-july-16-17-with-millions-of-exclusive-deals-for-prime-members%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3dfbacbc-81dc-4055-b661-8b771b565a5b%7Cdtp%23link%3D%7B%22role%22%3A%22standard%22%2C%22href%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fpress.aboutamazon.com%2F2024%2F6%2Famazons-10th-prime-day-event-returns-july-16-17-with-millions-of-exclusive-deals-for-prime-members&dtb=1) that new deals may surface as often as every five minutes on the site. As always, deals only last as long as Amazon decides, with Lightning Deals offering a countdown to their expiration, and other deals' longevity depending on how fast products sell out (or don't).

### How did we choose these Prime Day deals?

At ZDNET, we only write about deals our team members would want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. We looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops.

We also look over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we recommend. These recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.

### When will these deals expire?

Prime Day has ended, so deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on a deal, but don't fret -- we're constantly finding new chances to save and sharing them with you at [ZDNET.com](https://www.zdnet.com/).
