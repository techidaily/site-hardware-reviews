There's nothing like attaching a couple of extra displays to a laptop to boost productivity. Sure, it isn't mobile anymore, but you gain the ability to transform your device into a powerful, versatile desktop setup.

The problem is, that not all laptops natively support dual displays, not even quite powerful, high-end systems such as the base M1, M2, and M3-powered Macs. These MacBooks only support a single external monitor.

So, what can you do?

A simple solution is to use a USB-C to dual-HDMI dongle, such as the [Plugable USB-C Dual HDMI adapter](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPlugable-DisplayLink-Multiple-Thunderbolt-USBC-6950M%2Fdp%2FB0CS8D3KF2%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C2e023405-72da-4815-975c-a61397985ae8%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

Laptops were supposed to free us from the shackles of a desk and big displays. But as the power of portable systems has increased exponentially over the years, a laptop can now rival the power of a desktop, so it makes sense to have a single system for the office and for when you're on the move. The only drawback is the display -- there's nothing like sitting in front of a couple of 4K displays to boost productivity.

Plugable USB-C Dual HDMI adapter

This is exactly what the Plugable USB-C Dual HDMI adapter offers, and it works even on systems that don't natively support dual displays. Plug it into a USB-C, Thunderbolt, or USB4 port, install the relevant DisplayLink drivers (a process that's automatic on Windows systems, [Mac users will have to go find them](https://plugable.com/products/usbc-6950m)), and you're done.

It's really that simple.

While the target market for this adapter includes owners of Macs with the base M1, M2, or M3 chips -- processors that don't natively support dual displays -- it also works on Windows and ChromeOS systems. 

I've tested this adapter with dual 4K displays attached, and it works reliably on both macOS and Windows -- the sort of reliability that I'd expect from a Plugable device.
