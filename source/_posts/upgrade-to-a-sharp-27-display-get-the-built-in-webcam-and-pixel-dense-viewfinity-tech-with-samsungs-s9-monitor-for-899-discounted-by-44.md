 One of this monitor's standout features is its ability to calibrate your monitor with your smartphone. With the smart calibration app on your phone, you can choose between either the DCI-P3 or sRGB color space and set your preferences, color temperature, luminance, and gamma settings.

 The ViewFinity S9ere has many connectivity ports available: 1x Thunderbolt 4, 1x mini-DisplayPort, and 3x USB-C (3DN). The stand on the S9 lets you view the screen in either landscape or portrait and is height, tilt, and swivel adjustable. Of course, you could also mount it to a wall or monitor arm, as Vesa mounting is also an option.
