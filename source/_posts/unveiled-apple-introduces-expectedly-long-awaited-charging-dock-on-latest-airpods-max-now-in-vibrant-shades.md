Along with the [iPhone 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-iphone-16s-new-camera-button-is-the-feature-im-most-excited-about-heres-how-it-works/), [Apple Watch Series 10](https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-are-the-new-apple-watches-coming-out-what-to-know-and-where-to-preorder/), and [iOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ios-18-1-update-every-iphone-model-that-will-support-apples-new-ai-features-for-now/), Apple also announced a slew of updates to its line of AirPods, including the AirPods Max. The latest iteration of Apple's premium-grade, over-ear headphones is available for the same $549 price but offers a host of new features.

One of the biggest changes in the new AirPods Max is the switch from Apple's proprietary Lightning port to a universal USB-C port for charging and data transfer, in order to comply with laws in the EU that make USB-C the standard for charging. You'll still get a premium build with stainless steel adjustable arms for a custom fit and anodized aluminum outer ear cups to keep the headphones lightweight while trying to resist damage and corrosion.

There's no upgrade for the H1 chip, however, so these headphones may lag a bit behind their H2-using, in-ear counterparts like the [AirPods 4](https://www.zdnet.com/article/when-are-the-new-airpods-coming-out-what-to-know-and-where-to-preorder/).

With the iOS 18 update, the AirPods Max are set to gain support for Apple's ANC technology and [spatial audio](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/what-is-spatial-audio-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) tracking. This should give the headphones the ability to create an immersive and personalized experience while listening to music and podcasts and crystal-clear conversations while taking video or audio calls.

Apple also introduced five new colors for the AirPods Max: midnight, blue, purple, orange, and starlight. This means you can get a pair to match your new iPhone or to show off more of your personal style. 

You can preorder the newest version of the Apple AirPods Max starting today (September 9, 2024) for the [hefty price of $549](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airpods%2Fairpods-max&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp). The AirPods Max will officially launch on September 20, 2024\.
