 Before we get into the tricks, let's start with the basics. As you'll see later in this article, there are multiple ways to take screenshots on some Android devices. However, there is one [way to take a screenshot on Android](https://location-social.techidaily.com/3-things-you-must-know-about-fake-snapchat-location-on-samsung-galaxy-f15-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) that works on practically all Android devices across the board.

 Simply press and hold the Power Button + Volume Down until the screen flashes. If the screenshot was taken, you'll see a small preview thumbnail in the corner of the screen. Easy as that.

##  Samsung Galaxy Phones Have a Lot of Methods

 The first tip is actually a handful of tips. If you are the owner of a Samsung Galaxy phone, the standard Power + Volume Down method is just one of your options. In fact, there are [five different ways to take screenshots](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/gamers-guides-essential-tips-for-recording-riveting-races/) on Samsung devices.

* Power + Volume Down
* Palm Gesture
* Capture a Long or Scrolling Screenshot
* Smart Select
* Hey Bixby

##  Take Scrolling Screenshots

 What if you want to take a screenshot of more than what appears on the screen? [A "scrolling" screenshot](https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/downloading-the-linksys-ae1200-driver-made-easy-and-quick-for-all-users/) can capture long screenshots, such as a full webpage.

 The process for doing this is straightforward. You'll take a screenshot with one of the regular methods, then select the scrolling screenshot icon on the thumbnail preview. From there, you'll either be able to scroll more to capture more, or be presented with a crop-able version of the full page.

 You don't have to touch the screen or press any buttons to take a screenshot if you don't want to. Google Assistant has the ability to take screenshots on Android devices. All you need to do is say the command:

* "Hey Google, take a screenshot."

 The screenshot will be captured, and you'll immediately see the options to share, edit, or delete the screenshot.
