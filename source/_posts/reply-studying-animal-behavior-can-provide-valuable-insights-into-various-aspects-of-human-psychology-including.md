## Anticipated Announcements at Apple's Upcoming October Showcase: The New M4 Mac Mini, Advanced iPads, and Latest Innovations in Siri Technology - Insights

We're in the home stretch of 2024, but Apple isn't slowing down. The Cupertino-based tech giant is expected to hold a second Fall media event later this month. While recent history suggests the event could take place anytime before the end of October, our money's on mid-month. It's an election year in the US, and Apple probably doesn't want its news overshadowed. 

**Also: [M3 MacBook Air vs M2 MacBook Air: Which Apple laptop should you buy?](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m3-macbook-air-vs-m2-macbook-air/)**

Expect an official announcement confirming the event date within the next week or so. As usual, the presentation likely will kick off at 10 a.m. PT / 1 p.m. ET on YouTube and [Apple's website](https://www.apple.com/). With those details out of the way, one question remains: What's planned for the event?

So far this year, we've already seen new [iPhones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-announced-at-apples-iphone-16-glowup-event-ai-apple-watch-10-airpods-more/), [iPads](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/), and [Apple Watches](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-apple-watch/), so the most significant product category clamoring for updates are Mac computers. Below is a list of what I think will be the stars of Apple's upcoming show.

## 1\. M4 Macs

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

Earlier in the year, Apple released a [revamped iPad Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-review/) housing its new M4 chipset. The processor has proven to be powerful, fast, and reliable, and it's one of the main reasons we loved the device. Logic dictates that the same processor would eventually make its way to a new MacBook and iMac.

**Review:[I replaced my MacBook with M4 iPad Pro and was less bothered than I expected](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ipad-pro-2024-review/)**

[In his most recent newsletter](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-10-01/apple-readies-iphone-se-4-upgraded-ipad-air-for-early-2025?srnd=undefined), Apple watcher Mark Gurman stated that the M4 chip will be used in the upcoming MacBook Pros and iMacs. Gurman doesn't say whether or not there will be different configurations, but we expect to see the base M4 as well as M4 Pro and M4 Max options for the two Mac models. 

We also predict that Apple will show off the next MacBook Pro in two sizes -- one with a 14-inch display and the second with a 16-inch display. Gurman claims the "M4 chip will come to the MacBook Air, Mac Studio, and Mac Pro" next year.

## 2\. New Mac Mini

Michael Gariffo/ZDNET

The Mac Mini is overdue for an update as the [current model](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmac-mini&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) only has an M2 chip. As Apple's smallest desktop computer skipped the M3 generation, the M4 chip would allow it to catch up to other Apple hardware. In addition to the internal upgrade, multiple sources suggest the new Mac Mini will see several external changes.

**Review: [Apple Mac Mini (2023) review: Faster, cheaper, better](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-mac-mini-2023-review/)**

It's been reported that the model will emphasize the "Mini" in its name, shrinking to the width of an Apple TV box -- about four inches across. The [future Mac Mini](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-mac-mini-m4-powered-yet-small-as-an-apple-tv/#link={) will be taller to compensate for the smaller width.

[Tech reporter Aaron Perris](https://x.com/aaronp613/status/1835739463751782807) discovered a code string inside Apple software in mid-September, revealing that the Mac Mini has five ports. It's unknown precisely what kind of ports they are, but [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/09/16/mac-mini-5-usb-c-ports-leak/) believes they are five Thunderbolt 4 ports. In contrast, the M2 Mac Mini has two Thunderbolt 4 inputs.

## 3\. New iPads

Adam Breeden/ZDNET

In his recent newsletter, Gurman also claimed that by the end of 2024, there would be three new iPad models -- two iPad Air tablets plus an iPad Mini. He didn't reveal much about them besides the two iPad Airs "will focus on internal improvements." This is probably a reference to the introduction of the M4 chip.

**Also: [Why I'm more excited about an iPad Mini with Apple Intelligence than the new iPhone 16 models](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-im-more-excited-about-an-ipad-mini-with-apple-intelligence-than-the-new-iphone-16-models/)**

The [last iPad Mini](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-ipad-mini-wi-fi-6th-generation-tablet-64-gb-8-3-mk7p3lla/) was released about three years ago, and much has changed since then. We don't expect this tablet to receive the M4 chip, as iPad Minis are designed to be Apple's low-cost tablet. Instead, there's a good chance it'll receive M1 or M2 hardware, which would allow it to run Apple Intelligence.

## 4\. More Apple Intelligence

Kerry Wan/ZDNET

Although the Mac models will take center stage at the event, we expect Apple Intelligence to make an appearance, albeit a small one. Many AI features still aren't available to iPhone users. These include but are not limited to [Genmoji](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apples-new-ai-generated-genmoji-solve-a-problem-weve-all-had-before/), the Image Playground, and ChatGPT integration.

**Also: [6 AI features iPhone users can expect first on iOS 18 (and what's coming later)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-ai-features-iphone-users-can-expect-first-on-ios-18-and-whats-coming-later/)**

iOS 18.1 should leave its beta state and officially roll out within the coming weeks. An early version of iOS 18.2 will likely be released soon after to testers. In the upcoming patch, we could finally see Genmoji and the other Apple Intelligence features on the iPhone. But we can't say for sure until the event kicks off. Be sure to stay tuned for ZDNET's coverage.
