##  Leading the PC-Focused OLED Revolution

![MSI MAG 341CQP QD OLED with deep black](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/04/msi-mag-341cqp-qd-oled-oled-black.jpg) 

Mark LoProto / How-to Geek

 The first OLED televisions are over a decade old, so the technology has had some time to improve. PC monitor OLED displays are [still relatively new](https://www.pcgamer.com/heres-why-first-gen-oled-gaming-monitors-arent-truly-pc-optimized/), with the first hitting the market in 2022, so there was an expectation of ongoing growth and settling into the technology. I’m sure there’s still more to add to enhance the tech but save for some slight fixes to less important features, MSI’s QD-OLED makes it hard to imagine what improvements could come.

 With the MAG 341CQP QD-OLED, MSI has me nearly completely on board with the $900 price tag. The vivid 1800R curved panel surprised me immediately with its reflection-free surface (the perks of a curved display) and the color accuracy of the out-of-the-box settings.

 I ran the monitor through the quick [EIZO Monitor Test](https://www.eizo.com/library/basics/eizo-monitor-test/) and, as expected with a [QD-OLED](https://win-answers.techidaily.com/solved-metro-exodus-pc-enhanced-edition-keeps-crashing/), it excelled in displaying a smooth color gradient and showcased its impressive range of different colors. However, I wanted to see its color accuracy in action, so I booted up one of the most vibrant and dark games I own—“Ghostwire: Tokyo.”

 Tango Gamework’s haunted neon iteration of Tokyo popped on the MSI QD-OLED more so than it did on my calibrated [HyperX Armada 24](https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-a-step-by-step-guide-for-creating-channel-trailers-that-convert-viewers-into-customers/). The above image shows how well the QD-OLED handles a broad spectrum of colors, particularly in the deeper reds present on the billboard. There’s even a better contrast between darker surfaces and shadows, allowing me to see more of the world at once.

 Even when just comparing a similar desktop wallpaper, it’s evident that MSI focused on color accuracy and deep blacks for its newest gaming monitor.

###  Smooth, Adaptive Refresh Rate

 Though newer and higher-end monitors are coming with a 280Hz minimum refresh rate, the MAG 341CQP QD-OLED tops out at 175Hz. The Adaptive-Sync dynamic refresh rate kept up with every game I tested without issue, preventing screen tearing and stuttering during the chaotic high frames-per-second action of “DOOM: Eternal.”

 The fluidity of tearing through demons felt so much better than it did during my original console playthrough. While 175Hz is overkill for most games, it’s a nice option to have. Adaptive-Sync is the real star of the show, keeping things steady no matter what’s unfolding on the screen.

##  A Monitor Made for Gamers

 I’ve been a gamer for longer than I care to admit. In that time, I’ve played on several monitors, from higher-end gaming displays to more casual screens. Before I started my test of MSI’s QD-OLED, I worked with both [Gigabyte’s M27F A monitor](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-champion-firefox-capture-extensions/) and my HyperX display, which I thoroughly enjoyed. As much as I like them, though, I’d spend the extra $200-ish on top of their cost to have MSI’s ultra-wide QD-OLED monitor on my desk.

 That’s not a jab at either Gigabyte or HyperX. Both are fine models that I highly recommend. When it comes to gaming, though, MSI hit all the sweet spots and more. There are so many settings and features on the 34-inch monitor that I’m simply not used to. Sure, I’ve had access to the Game Mode visual presets, but Taskbar, Multi-Logo, Boundary, and Static Screen Detection were new to me.

###  A Feature-Rich Gaming Companion

 MSI clearly has streamers in mind, as each detection setting, added as part of MSI’s OLED Care 2.0, prevents burn-in from stationary images or dark lines. Along with the edges of multiple windows set side-by-side, streamers may also have their logos visible on screen. For both, the monitor adjusts luminance to prevent the image from burning into the monitor. When activated, Taskbar and Boundary Detection reduce the luminance of the taskbar or hard boundary lines (e.g., when splitting the monitor between two windows).

Close 

 One feature I had maybe way too much fun with was the Optix Scope toggle. When active, a center square of the screen became magnified, typically where a first-person shooter reticle would land. Is it cheating? Probably, but I was still rubbish even with it active.

 Many gaming monitors, like the HyperX Armada, allow you to toggle a stagnant, colored crosshair on the screen. MSI takes it a step further with its Smart Crosshair, which changes color to improve visibility based on the background. Again, it’s probably cheating, but it’s such a fun feature, especially if you’re practicing with friends.

###  Maybe Too Many Features?

 I’m not often overwhelmed by monitors. MSI’s menu is a little intimidating, and I fear I could never remember to use everything the panel offers. For example, there’s a KVM switch that I only tested very briefly (to positive results), a night vision mode, an alarm clock, multiple brightness and contrast presets, and a host of MSI OLED Care options. If you’re not used to having so much control over your monitor, you could easily under-utilize some of the display’s best features.

Close 

 For example, MSI added an A.I. Vision toggle, which lets the monitor decide how to adjust its settings to enhance brightness, saturate colors, and make the image more defined. There are also options for Image Enhancement, which sharpens or softens the picture to your liking, and a mode to reduce blue light. I also had a little fun with the picture-in-picture and picture-by-picture, which produces a small window for another connected device. ,

 If you are going to spring for this QD-OLED, familiarize yourself with everything it can do so you’re not missing out on some nifty options to enhance the viewing experience. Thankfully, the monitor lets you customize the four-axis navigation stick, so you can adjust your favorite or most-used features instantly without moving through the menu.

##  Should You Buy the MSI MAG 341CQP QD-OLED Monitor?

 I think I would have a difficult time not recommending this monitor to gamers. The [MSI MAG 341CQP QD-OLED](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-MAG341CQP-QD-OLED-Monitor-Response/dp/B0CTRXPJMC?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2002712&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fmsi-mag-341cqp-qd-oled-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) monitor checks off most of the “must-have” boxes with a feature list that’s a mile long. The 34-inch display is bright and clear, delivering a picture that will make virtually any video game look good, and the [Adaptive Sync refresh rate,](https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/in-2024-mastering-the-art-of-meme-craftsmanship/) capable of 175Hz, caters to even the fastest-paced games.

 Good viewing angles, anti-reflection treatment, an impressive .03ms response time, and a color accuracy that’s out of this world all come together to make the MAG 341CQP one of, if not the best QD-OLED currently on the market. The $900 retail [price tag may be hefty](https://screen-mirroring-recording.techidaily.com/az-recorder-expert-series-app-deep-dives/), but MSI makes it easier to justify with a big beautiful panel that gives you plenty to tinker with.
