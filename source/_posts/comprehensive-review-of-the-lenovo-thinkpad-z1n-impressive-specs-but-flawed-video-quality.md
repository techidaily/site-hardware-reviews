Lenovo's ThinkBook Plus series is an interesting family of laptops. Each generation does something completely different from the last. The [fourth generation](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovos-new-thinkbook-plus-is-the-most-interesting-2-in-1-laptop-ive-used-all-year/) had an e-ink display, and the one before that had a small screen next to the keyboard. The Gen 5 Hybrid is doing something out of left field again, with Lenovo taking the idea of a "2-in-1 laptop" quite literally.

**Also: [This inexpensive laptop brings back a buzzword that was once the talk of the tech industry](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-inexpensive-laptop-brings-back-a-buzzword-that-was-once-the-talk-of-the-tech-industry/)**

2-in-1 computers, for the most part, tend to just be a laptop with a touchscreen that bends all the way back. The [ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkbook%2Fthinkbook-plus%2Flenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-5-hybrid-14-inch-station-and-tab%2Flen101b0047%3F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), on the other hand, is two devices rolled into one. It consists of a tablet and a keyboard, each housing different hardware.

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Even if it didn't have the two chipsets, Lenovo's ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 would still do great as a traditional laptop thanks to its solid hardware performance and OLED display. View at Lenovo](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkbook%2Fthinkbook-plus%2Flenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-5-hybrid-14-inch-station-and-tab%2Flen101b0047%3F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1)

It's not a large device, sporting a vibrant 14-inch 2.8K OLED touchscreen. Still, the tablet houses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 SoC running Android 13, while the keyboard houses an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor running Windows 11\. So, you have two different ecosystems on the same device, and you can hop between them by pressing the Super key next to F12.

The two sides don't operate completely separately from each other. You can send files from one system to another via the Hybrid Folder.

For example, let's say you have a big work project. You can do the intensive workloads on Windows 11 and then send the files over to the Android side for further editing, image creation, or whatever you need. 

**Also: [The ThinkPad I recommend for hybrid workers is not Lenovo's newest model](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-thinkpad-i-recommend-for-hybrid-workers-is-not-lenovos-newest-model/).**

The Android side functions similarly to a [Chromebook](https://www.zdnet.com/article/6-reasons-why-a-chromebook-is-the-best-laptop-for-most-anyone/) \-- you get all the G Suite apps as well as a couple of YouTube apps. You can remove the display from the keyboard at any time to use it as a tablet, although you will need to pull on it with a bit of force (the connecting magnets are quite strong).

I had a great time using the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid, at first. The more I used it, however, the more I wondered who would want to do so regularly. It's a niche product that I can't imagine getting widespread adoption.

My main problem is that the integration of both systems is only surface level. They're not deeply intertwined. Each half has its own storage space, RAM, processor, and more. It's not like you can install an app on the Windows side and access it on the Android side.

**Also: [Lenovo's new $749 ThinkBook may be the best-value Windows laptop of 2024\. Here's why](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovos-new-749-ideapad-may-be-the-best-value-windows-laptop-of-2024-heres-why/)**

Pushing the lack of cohesion aside, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 does pretty well as both a laptop and a tablet. I was able to navigate the internet, write, and handle multiple open pages without experiencing any major slowdown.

The benchmark tests for the Intel Core Ultra 7 revealed it performs at a similar level to other laptops with the same piece of hardware. The benchmark tests I ran on the Android tablet revealed the device performs below the level of a Galaxy S23, but better than the [Galaxy Z Fold 4](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-4-review/). So good, but not amazing.

Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET

Despite having two batteries, Lenovo's device doesn't have a long runtime. With the two halves connected and running Windows 11 on Best Performance mode, the ThinkBook Plus ran for almost eight hours. On the Best Power Efficiency plan, it lasted a little longer: around 8.5 hours.

**Also: [How we test laptops at ZDNET in 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-laptops/)**

I was surprised to see this because I thought the Power Efficiency would increase the battery life by a good amount, but that just wasn't the case. I also tested the Android tablet's battery separately from the keyboard, and it did much better. It ran for almost 10 hours straight.

Unfortunately, there isn't a way to use Windows 11 on just the tablet -- you have to use Android.

## ZDNET's buying advice

The [Lenovo ThinkBookPlus Gen 5 Hybrid](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Fthinkbook%2Fthinkbook-plus%2Flenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-5-hybrid-14-inch-station-and-tab%2Flen101b0047&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) starts at $3,518\. Due to its high price tag and unorthodox dual system, I can't recommend this to most people. The fifth-generation ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 just doesn't offer an engaging laptop experience beyond its, admittedly fun, gimmick.

Not only is it expensive, but its design makes it difficult to use. This model has only four ports: three USB-C and one for headphones. There's nothing for USB-A or HDMI. For most users, I recommend getting something that specializes in either Windows 11 or Android, such as the [Lenovo Slim 7](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-lenovo-laptop-impressed-me-with-two-quintessential-features-for-power-users/).
