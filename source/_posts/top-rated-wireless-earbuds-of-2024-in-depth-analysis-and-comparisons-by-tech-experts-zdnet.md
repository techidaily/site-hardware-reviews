### Bose QuietComfort Ultra

#### Best wireless headphones overall

Bose's latest QuietComfort Ultra headphones are the ultimate wireless headphones. They offer great audio quality, superior noise-canceling properties, and all-day comfort. 

I tested the QuietComfort Ultra when they were released last fall, and they're still my favorite pair of everyday headphones. The plush vegan leather earpads have perforations for ventilation, and their modern design makes them stylish and fashionable.

**Review:** [**Bose QuietComfort Ultra**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review/)

Bose improved its sound profile with the QuietComfort Ultra, emphasizing the headphones' bass response, which was weaker in the past in previous headphones. However, the QuietComfort Ultra headphones do not have a balanced or neutral sound profile, so if that's your preferred sound, you may want to look elsewhere.

These headphones debut with Bose's take on spatial audio, Immersive Audio. When I tested Immersive Audio, I thought it was a hit or miss. Some songs sounded wider, deeper, and multidimensional, while other songs sounded strange with the digital sound alteration.

Along with the new feature, Bose also improves upon its active noise cancellation, which is the best I've tested yet. The QuietComfort Ultra perform best over a Bluetooth connection, making them best suited for commuters, frequent flyers, and desk workers.

**Bose QuietComfort Ultra** **tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth version:** v5.3 | **Battery life:** 24 hours | **Driver size:** 35mm | **Noise cancellation:** Yes

### Sony WH-1000XM5

#### Best casual use wireless headphones

You can't have a conversation about premium wireless headphones without mentioning the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones. The headband and ear cups are padded and finished in faux leather for all-day comfort as well as a sleek, elegant look. An eight-microphone array not only ensures that your voice will be heard loud and clear during phone calls but also helps with the adaptive noise-canceling technology, so your music, podcasts, and calls are the only thing you hear in almost any environment.

**Review:** [**Sony WH-1000XM5**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sony-wh-1000xm5-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-review/)

When ZDNET's Matthew Miller reviewed the headphones last year, he complimented the headphone's "stunning" audio performance and immersive ANC. "I spent the last couple of months traveling, commuting, working, and relaxing with the headphones and didn't think the XM4 could get better, but Sony found a way," Miller writes. 

The XM5's 30 hours of playback time, three-minute quick charge feature, effective noise-canceling properties, and all-day comfort make them a great candidate for commuters and travelers. 

**Sony WH-1000XM5** **tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth version:** v5.2 | **Battery life:** 30 hours | **Driver size:** 30mm | **Noise cancellation:** Yes

### Monoprice BT-600ANC

#### Best cheap wireless headphones

If you're looking for headphones with great sound, strong noise-canceling, and immense comfort for less than $150, look no further than the Monoprice BT-600ANC headphones. The BT-600ANC are perfect for casual listeners who want affordable headphones with noise-canceling that rivals Sony and Bose.

If your daily commute is noisy or you often work in shared spaces, you need headphones that can block out an array of sounds and disturbances. The BT-600ANC can shield you from external noises without demanding a high price tag.

**Review: [Monoprice BT-600ANC](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dont-overpay-for-noise-canceling-headphones-when-this-60-pair-sounds-this-amazing/)**

I don't recommend these headphones for audio buffs, as they have an incredibly bass-forward sound and lack a companion app with EQ settings. When I tested the BT-600ANC, I was surprised by their noise-canceling properties but not overly impressed by their sound profile.

Still, the BT-600ANC have thick, plushy ear cups suitable for all-day wear and a battery life that's sure to keep the headphones going all week. Monoprice includes a sturdy carrying case, a USB-C cable, and a 3.5mm headphone cable with your purchase.

Design-wise, the BT-600ANC resembles Sony's WH-1000XM4 headphones, offering a utilitarian, sturdy, and reliable form factor.

**Monoprice BT-600ANC** **tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth version:** v5.0 | **Battery life:** 40 hours | **Driver size:** 40mm | **Noise cancellation:** Yes

### Beats Solo 4

#### Best on-ear wireless headphones

If you prefer on-ear headphones over over-ear headphones, you can't go wrong with the new Beats Solo 4\. These headphones' on-ear fit and slim form factor foster increased portability, and their lack of noise-canceling tech allows for up to 50 hours of continuous playback.

**Review:** [**Beats Solo 4**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-beats-new-solo-4-headphones-and-these-3-features-stand-out-the-most/)

Beats recently released the Solo 4 and they debuted with many upgrades and improvements their predecessor lacked, such as a more neutral sound profile, an updated design, longer battery life, USB-C audio playback, and better compatibility with both iOS and Android devices.

I tested the Solo 4 and enjoyed their new sound profile. In the past, Beats headphones had an overemphasized bass response, which was too much for some people, even bass lovers like me. The Solo 4 also sport Beats' new UltraPlush ear cups, making them thicker and more suited for hours-long wear.

Beats implemented Personalized Spatial Audio in the Solo 4, so if you're looking for more affordable headphones with If you want a pair of lowkey, easy-to-use headphones, the Solo 4 are a great option.

**Beats Solo 4** **tech specs: Form factor:** On-ear | **Bluetooth version:** v5.3 | **Battery life:** 50 hours | **Driver size:** 40mm | **Noise cancellation:** No

### Shure Aonic 50 Gen 2

#### Best wireless headphones for music

If you're looking for wireless headphones that deliver top-tier sound, all-day comfort, and not much else, the Shure Aonic 50 Gen 2 are right up your alley. These headphones have a USB-DAC mode, so you can take advantage of higher bit depths and sample rates with a USB-C cable. These headphones are highly customizable, so you can tailor them exactly to your sound preferences.

When I tested the Aonic 50 Gen 2, I found their large ear cups to deliver immense comfort, and their Bluetooth multipoint connectivity was reliable and stable. The Aonic 50 Gen 2 are equipped with noise-canceling tech, but it's not nearly as strong as other ANC-enabled headphones in this list. 

The Aonic 50 Gen 2's 50mm dynamic drivers produce an excited, bass-forward sound that won't suit those who enjoy a neutral sound profile. Additionally, there is a distinct difference in these headphones' sound profiles depending on whether they have ANC turned on or off.

However, the Aonic 50 Gen 2 have a great battery life, as you can squeeze out about 30 hours with noise-canceling turned on and 45 hours with ANC off. I recommend these headphones for people who spend most of their time wearing headphones in the office or on a school campus. 

**Shure Aonic 50 Gen 2 tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth version:** v5.0 | **Battery life:** 45 hours | **Driver size:** 50mm | **Noise cancellation:** Yes

### Apple AirPods Max

#### Best headphones for Apple users

If you are an Apple ecosystem devotee, you can't go wrong with Apple's AirPods Max for the headphones' suite of iOS-exclusive features like instant connectivity to Apple devices, multi-device switching, access to Siri, and spatial audio. 

**Review:** [**AirPods Max**](https://www.zdnet.com/product/apple-airpods-max/)

But even if you don't own Apple products, you will nevertheless fall in love with the headphones' comfortable fit and futuristically sleek appearance. The AirPods Max has progressed past mere headphone status; they're now a fashion piece, too. Still, non-Apple devices miss out on multi-device connectivity and spatial audio, so I wouldn't recommend spending $500 on these unless you have at least one Apple device.

When ZDNET contributor Jason Cipriani reviewed the headphones in 2020, he acknowledged the high price tag but ultimately decided that the headphones were worth it in the end when you factor in the sound, style, features, and fit. 

AirPods Max have a bass-forward sound that most music lovers will enjoy. Despite their slightly overemphasized bass, these headphones have Adaptive EQ settings, which adapt to the songs you're listening to. This feature ensures sounds in the midrange come through clearly.

AirPods Max are not optimized for wired listening, making them the ultimate wireless companion. If you frequently travel or work in shared spaces, these headphones have noise-canceling that's sure to keep you protected from external distractions.

**AirPods Max tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth version:** v5.0 | **Battery life:** 20 hours | **Driver size:** 40mm | **Noise cancellation:** Yes

If you like spatial audio, the QuietComfort Ultra feature Bose's Immersive Audio, which allows you to listen in spatial audio regardless of your device or music streaming platform.  
If you're not sold on the QuietComfort Ultra, here's how they stack up against the other options.

## Which are the right wireless headphones for you?

The biggest thing to take into consideration when shopping for a new pair of wireless headphones, other than price, is battery life. You want your wireless headphones' battery to last an entire work or school day plus your commute home (about eight to 10 hours) before you need to recharge. There are a few other things to consider before you make a decision, so let's break it down.

| **Choose these headphones...** | **If you want...**                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

## Factors to consider when buying wireless headphones

Other than price, the biggest thing to consider when shopping for a new pair of wireless headphones is battery life. You want your wireless headphones' battery to last an entire work or school day, plus your commute home (about eight to 10 hours) before recharging. There are a few other things to consider before deciding, so let's break it down.

* **Bluetooth version:** A pair of headphones' Bluetooth version dictates how well they can wirelessly transmit data. Headphones with later Bluetooth versions usually have better audio quality, more stable Bluetooth connections, and more efficient power consumption. The latest version of Bluetooth is v5.4, which was released in early 2023\. However, it hasn't been widely adopted, so headphones with v5.3 (2021) offer the best Bluetooth features.
* **Audio quality:** There are a few metrics that determine sound quality. These metrics include the materials used in the internal audio components, Bluetooth version, and driver size. However, sound quality is a highly subjective metric, so you should rely on your ears and personal preferences. Consider headphones with a companion app so you can access EQ settings to customize bass, treble, and mid frequencies to your taste.
* **Price:** The headphones on this list range from mid-$100s to upwards of $500\. More premium features come with a more expensive price tag, but even headphones on the lower end of the price spectrum deliver impeccable sound and comfort.
* **Battery** **life:** Good sound only goes so far. Your headphones shouldn't unexpectedly die during a conference call or workout session. We included headphones with battery lives that range from 10 hours to 40 hours.
* **Comfort:** Comfort is another subjective metric, as a pair of comfortable headphones for someone else may be unbearable for you. Everyone has different head shapes and ear sizes, which dictates comfort. Consider headphones with large, oval ear cups if you have a larger head or ears. Consider headphones with circular ear cups if you have a smaller head or ears.

The ZDNET team spends weeks with a pair of headphones, using them in various environments, such as libraries, coffee shops, grocery stores, trains, and the office. We do so to test how well headphones perform in these environments, as each offers a different symphony of sounds.

Although you can test headphones objectively on a noise isolation graph or sound profile chart, you should conduct your own testing in your frequented environments to see how they hold up. At the end of the day, the only way to know if a pair of headphones works for you is to try them yourself.

## Should I buy wired or wireless headphones?

Wired and wireless headphones each have pros and cons. Fortunately, most headphones on this list have a headphone jack, allowing you to listen wired or wirelessly without buying a new pair. 

**You should listen wirelessly if:**

* You don't want to be tethered to your smartphone or laptop.
* You'll be moving around a lot when you're wearing your headphones.
* You prefer stylish and functional headphones.

**You should listen wired if:**

* You want to access higher-quality, uncompressed audio.
* You want decreased latency, especially when playing mobile games or watching videos on your smartphone.
* You don't want to worry about your headphones' battery dying.

## What are the cons of wireless headphones?

Wireless headphones don't have the best sound quality compared to wired headphones with analog signals. This drop in sound quality is because Bluetooth connections cannot transmit the large amounts of data that uncompressed audio files require. Uncompressed audio files are CD-quality or better, sometimes referred to as lossless audio or hi-res audio. These types of files are identified by their bit depth and sample rate.

Purchasing headphones that can access uncompressed audio files is particularly important if you're using them to produce, mix, or master music—any critical listening task. Wired headphones are also recommended for people who enjoy critically listening to music for enjoyment. If you are a casual listener, you probably wouldn't notice too much of a difference between compressed and uncompressed audio, and that's totally okay.

Another disadvantage is that you need to occasionally recharge them to get the most playback time from your wireless headphones. If your wireless headset also uses a 2.4GHz USB wireless dongle rather than Bluetooth to connect to devices, you may be unable to use it with smartphones and tablets. 

## Should I buy wireless headphones or earbuds?

Wireless headphones and earbuds offer advantages depending on your use cases and preferences. If you don't like having something physically in your ear, stick with headphones. Wireless headphones typically have a longer battery life than earbuds, too.

If you live an active lifestyle and want to listen wirelessly while running, walking, hiking, or exercising, I recommend purchasing wireless earbuds. Earbuds usually have an IP rating, which dictates how much water and dust ingress they can withstand before a malfunction occurs. Headphones typically do not have an IP rating, so companies did not test how they function when exposed to rain, water splashes, sweat, or submersion.

## Are there alternative wireless headphones worth considering?

There are about as many different types of wireless headphones as there are people who shop for them. Here's a short list of additional models that I thought were great options:
