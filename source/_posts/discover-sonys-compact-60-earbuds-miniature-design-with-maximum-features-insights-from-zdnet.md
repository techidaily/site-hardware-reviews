## Discover Sony's Compact $60 Earbuds: Miniature Design with Maximum Features - Insights From ZDNet

The audio market is seeing new additions every month, with companies like [Google](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-unveils-pixel-buds-pro-2-here-are-the-3-features-im-most-excited-about/), [Samsung](https://www.zdnet.com/article/im-a-staunch-apple-user-but-samsungs-galaxy-buds-3-pro-made-me-reconsider-my-loyalty/), and JBL refreshing their flagship earbuds. However, some companies, like Sony, are holding off on their more premium options and upgrading their budget buds instead.

Case in point: Sony's latest WF-C510 earbuds, the successor to the WF-500 earbuds from 2021, sport a closed-back, rounded form factor with angled silicone tips. They ditch the more expensive noise-canceling tech in favor of an Ambient sound mode and extensive compatibility with Sony's mobile app.

Although these earbuds can be considered a heavily stripped-down version of [Sony's flagship WF-1000X series earbuds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonys-new-wf-1000xm5-may-just-be-the-best-premium-earbuds-right-now/), the company says the WF-C510 debut has many upgrades compared to its predecessor. For example, Sony claims the WF-C510 are 20% smaller and 15%, or 0.8 grams, lighter than the WF-C500.

The decrease in size should make the WF-C510 more comfortable to wear for long periods, as some people found the WF-C500 too bulky and built up too much in-ear pressure. Instead of tap-and-swipe controls found on the premium Sony buds, the WF-C510 have buttons on the outer edges. We'll have to see if that's a deficit at all when we test them soon.

The WF-C510 have upgraded connectivity, using Bluetooth 5.3 instead of 5.0, which should allow for more stable connections and enhanced sound quality. They offer 11 hours of continuous playtime and 22 hours with the charging case. However, the WF-C510 don't have noise-canceling, so these are earbuds for people who always want to hear their surroundings.

The Sony WF-C510 are similar to the [Beats Solo Buds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-buying-advice-on-the-cheapest-wireless-earbuds-apple-currently-sells-and-theyre-not-airpods/), offering consumers a simple, no-frills audio experience. Unlike the Solo Buds, however, the WF-C510 have an official IPX4 rating, making them suitable for sweaty exercises and bouts in the rain. 

Their straightforward design and functionality make these earbuds best suited for people who want to jam out to songs while exercising.

The Sony WF-C510 are $40 cheaper than their predecessors, despite offering more and better features. They are now available for preorder for $60 in four colors: blue, black, white, and yellow. Stay tuned for the review.
