## Top-Ranking M.2 SSDs : Comprehensive Reviews by Tech Experts

There is no doubt about it: SSDs (solid-state drives) are the speed demons and rock-solid champions of reliability, leaving HDDs (hard disk drives) in the dust. However, not all SSDs are cut from the same cloth.

Traditional SSDs and HDDs rely on the tried-and-true SATA (Serial AT Attachment) port when connecting to a PC. But hold on tight because modern motherboards are bringing massive upgrades with a lightning-fast M.2 port on the motherboard itself. This turbocharged connection sets the stage for a mind-blowing performance that will leave tech enthusiasts weak at the knees. Say goodbye to sluggish loading times and hello to a whole new level of speed and efficiency. 

Buckle up, because the future is here, and it's fast, furious, and absolutely electrifying.

### Best M.2 SSD overall

This is my default drive that I turn to. It's solid, reliable, and reasonably priced. I've bought and used dozens of these in PCs and external storage enclosures and I've not had one fail on me.

You can definitely find cheaper M.2 drives out there, but I wouldn't want to trust them with my data, and you can find faster M.2 drives, but they are going to cost you a lot more. 

For a middle of the road drive, you can't beat this one, and all the online reviews support this conclusion.

## Crucial T705 Series SSD

### Best fast M.2 SSD

Put simply, the Crucial T705 Series SSD is one of the fastest drives that you can currently buy. 

This is the drive that I turn to when I want the fastest gaming performance or to put in systems that work with large photo/video/3D files. Yes, it's expensive, but if you want the speed, it's going to cost you.

**Review: [Crucial T705](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-the-worlds-fastest-ssd-and-the-results-will-make-power-users-cry/)**

Just as I'd expect, this drive has very positive reviews, with 80% giving it five stars. There are some concerns about heat, but I'm convinced this is normal, and the heat sinks are doing their job of shifting the heat away from the chips.

**Crucial T705 Series SSD features**: **Interface**: NVMe PCIe Gen5 | **Sequential read speeds**: Up to 14,500MB/s | **Sequential write speeds**: Up to 12,700MB/s

Cons 
* The price
* Can get quite hot in use

## WD\_BLACK 4TB SN850X Gaming M.2 SSD

### Best gaming M.2 SSD

I've been putting WD\_BLACK storage into high-end gaming PCs for years now, and they never disappoint. This M.2 drive is no exception. It's fast, reliable, and built from quality components to offer the best lifespan possible. I've used quite a few of these and never had one fail.

There are two versions, one with a heat sink and one without. I recommend the one with the heat sink because it will dissipate heat better, which in turn makes it more reliable and gives you a longer product lifespan.

These drives have consistently drawn favorable reviews, with owners commenting on performance and reliability.

## PNY CS3150 1TB SSD with Dual Fan Black Heatsink

### Best for fantastic cooling

One of the biggest killers of storage drives is heat. The faster the drive, the more waste heat it generates. And the CS3150 is a fast drive. Clocking sequential read and write speeds of 11,500MB/s and 8,500MB/s, respectively.

To keep the temperatures at a manageable level, the CS3150 not only features a massive heat sink, but also dual cooling fans.

**Review: [PNY CS3150](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-thumb-sized-accessory-gave-my-old-pc-an-instant-speed-boost/)**

I stress-tested the drive using [CrystalDiskMark](https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskmark/) and monitored the temperatures using [CrystalDiskInfo](https://crystalmark.info/en/software/crystaldiskinfo/), and -- despite my relentless thrashing of the CS3150 -- I could not get the temperatures to exceed the 70°C/158°F maximum operating temperatures. 

Note that the fans do require a free set of 4-pin fan header pins on the motherboard. This drive is quite new, so there aren't many reviews for it yet, but those I've seen suggest this drive lives up to expectations.

**PNY CS3150 features** **:** **Interface**: PCIe Gen5x4 | **Sequential read speeds**: Up to 11,500MB/s | **Sequential write speeds**: Up to 8,500MB/s

## Samsung 990 Pro w/Heatsink SSD

### Most powerful M.2 SSD, perfect for the PS5

Samsung is a big name in storage, and the PRO series has consistently offered the best performance, reliability, fantastic power efficiency, and life possible -- but at a price. 

When I need something that is going to be bombproof, then the 990 PRo is the drive that I turn to. This drive is fast and is about as reliable as it gets. Yes, I'm definitely paying extra for a bit more peace of mind, but there are times when it's worth it!

This drive gets close to five stars on Amazon -- which is quite something for a storage drive -- with review after review commenting on its incredible performance and high levels of reliability. 

**Samsung 990 Pro features** **:** **Interface**: PCIe Gen4x4 | **Sequential read speeds**: Up to 7,450MB/s | **Sequential write speeds**: Up to 6,900MB/s

Pros 
* Build your own fast portable storage

* No tools needed to assemble

Cons 
* Need to be comfortable handling components to assemble it

## Satechi USB-C Aluminum Tool-Free Enclosure for M.2 PCIE NVME and SATA SSD

### Best DIY M.2 SSD

This Satechi enclosure is the best way to build your own M.2 external storage drive. 

You buy the drive, pick the M.2 drive you need (if you're like me, you probably have some lying about), slip the drive into the enclosure, and away you go. Yes, it's that easy!

**Review: [Assemble your own portable storage with this Satechi SSD enclosure](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-the-worlds-fastest-ssd-and-the-results-will-make-power-users-cry/)**

I think this is a great alternative to buying a ready-made external drive. With this setup, if you ever need to replace or upgrade the drive, you can do it quickly and easily.

## What's the right M.2 storage drive for you?

Two things are going to add to the price of your M.2 purchase -- speed and capacity. The more of either one of these you need, the more it's going to cost.

## How did we choose these M.2 SSD storage drives?

I only recommend products that I've tested or used personally, and while there are many M.2 SSDs on the market, not every one is built the same. Here are some other factors I considered when testing and curating my top selections.

* **Real-world use:** When I test M.2 SSDs, I use them in a variety of systems, from basic PCs to high-end workstations, gaming systems, and drones, to CCTV systems under both easy and harsh conditions, to get a feel for how they actually work in the real world.
* **Benchmarks:** I'm also quite a nerd, and have carried out both real world and synthetic benchmarks on these M.2 SSDs. The tests included stress tests and performance tests (carried out using [CrystalDisk](https://crystalmark.info/) and [AJA System Test](https://www.aja.com/products/aja-system-test)).
* **User reviews:** I'm one person, so there's a limit to how much testing I can do, which is why I like to keep an eye out on what users are saying on social media, Reddit, Amazon, and other online retailers.

## What is an M.2 SSD storage drive?

M.2 is a type of solid-state drive (SSD) that is small and used for data storage. It connects directly to the motherboard of a computer, rather than using a traditional SATA III connection. This allows for faster data transfer speeds and improved performance compared to traditional SATA-based SSDs.

## How do you pronounce M.2?

In terms of pronunciation, "M.2" is typically pronounced "M-dot-two."

## Do M.2 drives have sizes?

Yes.

You'll see sizes like 2242, 2260, and 2280\. 

The first two numbers are the width in millimeters -- 22mm is the width of commercially available M.2 drives -- and the next two (or sometimes three) numbers are the length, again in millimeters.

Check the manual for your computer's motherboard or enclosure to know the size restrictions for the M.2 drive you can use.

## I've heard that M.2 drives have a "key." What's this?

M.2 slots come in two "keyings" that prevent the drive being inserted the wrong way. Older systems used a B key, and newer systems use an M key.

Modern drives come in two flavors -- M key or B+M, which will fit into both the newer and older slots.

## How do you fit an M.2 drive?

Fitting an M.2 drive is easy!

Find the M.2 connector on your motherboard (consult your manual if you are unsure). The contacts on the drive slots into the connector at an angle of 30 degrees from the motherboard. Not vertically. Not horizontal. At a shallow angle.

Insert the connector all the way into the slot, and then gently push it down flat to the motherboard, and finally affix it to the board using the retaining screw.

Done!

## Are there alternative M.2 drives worth considering?

Here are a few alternatives to the M.2 drives listed above, one perfect for the budget-conscious buyer.
