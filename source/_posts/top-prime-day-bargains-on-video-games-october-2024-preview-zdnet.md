## FAQs

### When is Amazon Prime Day 2024?

Amazon's Big Prime Deal Days, also known as Prime Day 2 or October Prime Day, will run through October 8 and 9\. Some brands may offer discounts and coupons ahead of the official sale. And other retailers like [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) and [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals%3FathAsset%3DeyJhdGhjcGlkIjoiMmU5ZjFjZmMtOTVhZC00NDlhLWEyNzgtZTU3ZTZlOTFjZmEwIn0%3D%26athena%3Dtrue&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) are running their own, rival sales at the same time. Which is great news for anyone who likes to compare discounts and prices to make sure they're getting the absolute best deal possible.

### Are games, consoles, and accessories really cheaper on Prime Day?

Games, consoles, and accessories can and do go on sale during Prime Day, though not every brand or manufacturer may participate. Some brands may have competing sales at other retailers or on their own direct-sale sites, which is great news for anyone who likes to compare discounts to make sure they're getting the best deal possible.

### How did we choose these Prime Day deals?

I only chose deals on games that have been critically and commercially well-received, as well as accessories and peripherals from well-known and reputable brands like Razer and Logitech. I also only included deals that offered at least a 15 percent discount.
