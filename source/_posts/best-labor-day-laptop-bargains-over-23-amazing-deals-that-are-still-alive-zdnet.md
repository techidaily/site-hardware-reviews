###  Are gaming devices and accessories really cheaper on Prime Day?

Most gaming items go on sale at steep discounts around the end-of-year holiday season, but if you're willing to be patient and keep tabs on multiple retailers, you can grab everything from physical or digital games and controllers to external hard drives, gaming monitors, and even console bundles. 

You can also save big during other summer sales events like the Steam Summer Sale (which ends today at 10 am Pacific/1 pm Eastern), PlayStation's Essential Picks and Games Under $15 sales, and Microsoft offering Xbox Game Pass Ultimate for both PC and console for just $1 for the first 14 days. Many developers and publishers offer rolling sales and discounts throughout the year on storefronts like Steam, Epic, and Origin. So make sure to check your wishlist often to see if you can snag a few games at a discount. If you're looking to pick up new, or at least new-to-you accessories like controllers, don't be afraid to pick up a pre-owned or refurbished model.

Used hardware can be a great value, as long as you practice due diligence and read all descriptions of the item's condition and any warranty or return/exchange terms in case you run into issues. Also, when you're buying pre-owned, make sure you're not buying third-party accessories as you'll have a harder time finding replacement parts or even reliable customer service as some brands may already be defunct.

###  How did we choose these Prime Day deals?

Discounts and sales on gaming consoles, computers, and accessories can feel like they're very few and far between, and sometimes when you do find a discount, it's not much better than paying full price. I only chose items that offered a significant (15 percent or more) discount or items that rarely go on sale, such as Nintendo games and consoles. I also chose accessories and peripherals from trusted, reputable brands with verified customer support and warranties.

### What is Amazon Prime Day?

Prime Day is Amazon's most popular flagship seasonal savings event, typically in mid-July each year. Although Amazon has since branched out to add an October Prime event and other sales, this July Prime Day remains the holy grail of Amazon sales. Prime Day grants Amazon Prime members exclusive access to deals on [Amazon.com](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ccf9d71b0-2fd4-4124-9bb6-4888895c85a0%7Cdtp&dtb=1) across all categories, including home, tech, apparel, and more.
