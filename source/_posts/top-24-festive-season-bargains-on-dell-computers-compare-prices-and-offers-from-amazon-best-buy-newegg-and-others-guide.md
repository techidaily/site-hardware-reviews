## How did we choose these Cyber Monday Costco deals?

As a Costco member, I'm always on the lookout for the best deals and, thankfully, Costco makes this easy by consistently offering great deals on high-quality items. Here at ZDNET, we do the legwork for you and round up the best ones through research, experience, and our own expertise.

## What's the best Costco membership type?

Costco, like some other retailers, offers a membership-based shopping experience both in its warehouses and online. Each membership is paid annually and includes a household card that you present at the store.

Here's how the different memberships stack up:

| **Gold** **Star**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Business**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Executive**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
