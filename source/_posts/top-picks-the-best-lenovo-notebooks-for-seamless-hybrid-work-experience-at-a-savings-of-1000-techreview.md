##  HP Dragonfly Pro series

Somewhat confusingly, HP's new Dragonfly Pro series is actually aimed at "freelancers wanting elevated experiences in their hybrid lives". This is a group, HP says, who require "technology with the power they need for multitasking and heavy workloads coupled with built-in support and services for peace of mind".

So as well as the usual attention to design, ergonomics, performance and battery life, HP has introduced one-touch access to its 24/7 live concierge service, along with optional 'total device protection' to cover mishaps like liquid spills or cracked screens. 

There are two 14-inch devices in the Dragonfly Pro series -- an AMD-powered PC and an Intel-powered Chromebook.

The AMD Ryzen7 7736u-based Dragonfly Pro is the first PC to feature the most advanced version of AMD's adaptive PMF (Platform Management Framework), HP says. PMF automatically manages the system's performance, power consumption and cooling, depending on how the laptop is being used. The Dragonfly Pro offers claimed battery life of up to 16 hours from its 64.6Wh battery. 

The Intel Core i5-1235U-based Dragonfly Pro Chromebook has an ultra-bright 1200 nits touch screen, an 8MP webcam, a customisable gaming-style RGB keyboard, and four USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports. The Dragonfly Pro Chromebook offers "all-day battery life" from its 51.3Wh battery.

HP's laptops for professional users have been updated to better serve hybrid-working modes, with enhanced video-conferencing capabilities powered by [HP Presence](https://www.hp.com/us-en/solutions/presence.html). A key innovation is support for dual video streams, camera switching, and the simultaneous use of two cameras -- showing the user and an object or whiteboard, for example. Other collaboration features include intelligent face tracking, keystone correction when sharing a whiteboard, and a 'Be Right Back' option that replaces the video feed with a still picture when you take a break. Later (spring 2023), HP will add a feature that automatically adjusts skin tone based on lighting conditions.

The 13.5-inch **Dragonfly G4**, HP's new flagship laptop for mobile pros, runs Windows 11 Pro on 13th-generation Intel Core processors with integrated graphics, and up to 32GB of RAM and up to 2TB of SSD storage. The weight starts at 2.2lbs (0.999kg) and the device comes in Slate Blue or Natural Silver. The 3:2 aspect ratio display is available at WUXGA+ resolution with 400 nits brightness, or 1000 nits with HP's Sure View Reflect privacy technology. There's also a 3K2K OLED option at 400 nits. Touch and non-touch versions are available. HP doesn't divulge the battery capacity, but fast-charge support delivers 50% charge in 30 minutes, the company says. Connections include two 40Gbps USB-C Thunderbolt 4/USB 4 ports and a 5Gbps USB-A port, plus an HDMI connector and a Nano SIM slot for optional 4G LTE or 5G mobile broadband. Despite its slim and light chassis, the Dragonfly G4 passes 19 MIL-STD-810H tests. 

In the UK, the Dragonfly G4 will be available in May from £1,699.

The 14-inch **EliteBook 1040 G10** and convertible **Elite x360 1040 G10** are more enterprise-focused Windows 11 Pro laptops, also based on 13th-generation Intel Core processors, with the former supporting up to 64GB of user-upgradeable RAM. Various 16:10 IPS screen options are available, with up to WQXGA resolution, 500 nits brightness, a 120Hz refresh rate, and touch capability on the x360 model. Standard (38Wh) or long-life (51.3Wh) batteries are available with 65W charging and fast-charge support. Both devices support the same connections as the Dragonfly G4, including mobile broadband, adding an optional smart card reader. Both laptops are also MIL-STD-810H tested.

In the UK, the EliteBook 1040 G10 will be available in May from £1,349, while the Elite x360 1040 G10 will start at £1,399.

Both the Dragonfly G4 and Elite 1000 series G10 laptops benefit from HP's Power Manager dashboard, where you can access battery information and customize settings and charging options. The Dragonfly G4 also includes an OLED power-saving mode. Another new feature, Intelligent Hibernate, learns your usage pattern and automatically goes into hibernation mode to conserve battery life when your day is done.

HP has doubled down on sustainability with its 14-inch and 15.6-inch Laptop PCs -- particularly the 14-inch Eco Edition, where up to 25% of the product uses post-consumer recycled plastics.

HP's new 24-inch and 27-inch All-In-One PCs are the company's most sustainable AIO PCs to date. HP says this is the world's first PC to use recycled coffee grounds, which are deployed as speckles in the computer's finish. More than 40% of the AIO's enclosure contains post-consumer recycled plastics, 75% recycled aluminum is used on the arm stand, and 100% reclaimed polyester is used on the stand base. Packaging is also 100% sustainably sourced and recyclable.
