## FAQs

### Does Best Buy price match Amazon Prime Day deals?

No. Best Buy's Price Match Guarantee does not apply to discounts that are exclusive to membership or loyalty programs offered by other retailers. Consequently, member-only events such as Amazon's October Prime Day are not eligible for price matching at Best Buy.

### How did we choose these Best Buy 48-Hour Flash Sale deals?

ZDNET only writes about deals we want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend. Our experts looked for deals that were at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops. 

We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter.
