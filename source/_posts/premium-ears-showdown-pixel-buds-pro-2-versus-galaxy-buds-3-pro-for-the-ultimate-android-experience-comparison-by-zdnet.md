Google's annual hardware event is here, and the new [Google Pixel Buds Pro 2](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Fbuds%5Fpro%5F2?hl=en-US) promise improvements to battery life, comfort, and more. But Google is following on the heels of Samsung, which [just released a new generation of its premium earbuds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-just-unveiled-its-new-galaxy-buds-3-here-are-the-features-im-most-excited-about/). With so many options, choosing which earbuds are best for you may be hard.

Despite Samsung and Google belonging to the Android operating system, these earbuds can be suitable for Apple fanatics too. However, Android users will get the most out of both buds. So, which brand-new Android-compatible premium earbuds are the best? Let's go over the key differences.

##  You should buy the Pixel Buds Pro 2 if...  

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

###  1\. You have a mixed-device ecosystem

Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 have very few Pixel smartphone-specific features, making them more suitable for people with a mix of Google, Apple, Samsung, or other devices. The features exclusive to Pixel smartphone owners are software features like [spatial audio](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/what-is-spatial-audio-heres-everything-you-need-to-know/) and Conversation Detection.

For other features like Find My Device, iPhone and Galaxy smartphone users can access Google's device-locating software on their web browser as long as they have a Google account. LE Audio, a Bluetooth feature that promotes more stable connections and enhanced sound quality, is compatible with Galaxy devices (but not Apple devices).

**Also: [The best earbuds: Expert tested and reviewed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-earbuds/)**

So, if you have an iPhone or Galaxy smartphone and don't like the earbuds within your device ecosystem, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 offer the most flexibility regarding your smartphone's operating system.

### 2\. You prefer a rounded bud design

Although Samsung recently ditched the rounded bud design, Google is staying true to it. However, Google says the new Pixel Buds are 27% smaller than their predecessors and debut with a twist-to-adjust stabilizer to keep them secure in your ears during intense exercise.

The rounded bud design is supposed to be more ergonomic, offering enhanced comfort and more effective noise-canceling.

###  3\. You prioritize battery life

Premium earbuds are notorious for their short battery life, which usually stops at 30 hours. This is due to their small form factor, which means smaller batteries and shorter battery longevity. But Google promises a whopping 48 hours of total listening time in the Pixel Buds Pro 2\.

If you constantly have an earbud in your ear but find yourself frustrated with how frequently you have to juice your buds, Google's Pixel Buds Pro 2 may be the solution you're looking for.

##  You should buy the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro if... 

Jada Jones/ZDNET

###  1\. You own mostly Galaxy devices

Samsung's newest premium earbuds offer a host of AI-powered features, thanks to its proprietary AI platform, [Galaxy AI](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-new-ai-feature-coming-to-samsungs-galaxy-z-fold-6-and-z-flip-6-and-how-they-work/). These features range from enhanced mic clarity to a real-time translation service. However, most of these earbuds' features are reserved for Galaxy devices. Even basic audio features like spatial audio, higher sound quality, and EQ settings can only be accessed with a compatible device.

So, if you want to take advantage of all the premium features these earbuds offer, you'll want to already be locked into the Galaxy ecosystem.

###  2\. You prioritize sound quality

The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have upgraded internal audio components to deliver incredibly detailed audio that's atypical of Bluetooth earbuds. The premium Galaxy Buds can achieve a 24-bit/96kHz sampling rate, but only with other Galaxy devices that support Samsung's proprietary Bluetooth codec.

**Also: [I'm a staunch Apple user, but Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro made me reconsider my loyalty](https://www.zdnet.com/article/im-a-staunch-apple-user-but-samsungs-galaxy-buds-3-pro-made-me-reconsider-my-loyalty/)**

However, iPhones and Google Pixel phones support AAC, a better-quality codec than SBC, the most basic Bluetooth codec. With AAC, you can still enjoy the Galaxy Buds' sophisticated dynamic driver and planar magnetic tweeter, which contribute to a smooth, clear sound profile.
