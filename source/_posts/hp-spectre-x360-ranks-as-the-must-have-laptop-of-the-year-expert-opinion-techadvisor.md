[The HP Envy x360 15 is on sale at Best Buy,](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-envy-x360-2-in-1-15-6-touch-screen-laptop-amd-ryzen-5-5625u-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-nightfall-black%2F6502184.p%3FskuId%3D6502184&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) and it caught our eye for a number of reasons. First, it's unique. It is a 15.6-inch widescreen 2-in-1, which is still fairly uncommon. (Its competition includes models like [Lenovo Yoga 7i](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-pro-14-inch-review/) and Dell Inspiron 15 2-in-1.) Second, the laptop is 40% off, but the deal ends Saturday night. You have until the end of the day on Nov. 26 to cash out.
