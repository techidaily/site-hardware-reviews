## The Impossibility of Fixing the Samsung Galaxy Ring

Companies are, at least publicly, doing their best to reduce the amount of waste and e-waste they put out. Sadly, the launch of the Samsung Galaxy Ring shows that at least Samsung might not be doing enough.

 The [Galaxy Ring](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/youtubes-erased-memories-how-to-revisit-them-online/), like other smart rings, faces a significant drawback: its disposable nature. The ring's lithium-ion battery, while offering a decent lifespan of around 400 charge cycles, cannot be replaced without destroying the device. This means that once the battery dies, the entire ring becomes e-waste. The issue of disposable tech is not new. With many of these smaller tech products, companies like to just make it permanently shut with no way to put it apart. Many people are unaware of the limited lifespan of lithium-ion batteries and the fact that you can't really throw these in the trash once they die, and companies like Oura specifically exclude batteries from their warranties.

 A closer look at the Galaxy Ring's internal structure, revealed through CT scans and a physical teardown, shows a simple design with a battery, inductive charging coil, and a press connector. While the press connector could have made battery replacement easier, it's sealed within the device, so it's not clear why Samsung decided to put one. Maybe it considered the possibility of trying to make this repairable at some point during development?

 The teardown also confirms the use of standard technology in the ring's electronics, similar to what's found in other smart rings. But ultimately, the Galaxy Ring's unrepairable nature makes it a disposable tech accessory with a limited lifespan. It may be aesthetically pleasing, sure, but if you do buy one, just know that once it starts malfunctioning or it dies, you will need to keep it around your house or [look for a proper way to dispose of it](https://sustainability.yale.edu/blog/how-sustainably-dispose-your-technological-waste).
