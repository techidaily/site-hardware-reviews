This is Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air with an M3 chip.

Apple

Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air M3 set the standard for ultraportable power when it burst onto the scene last year, offering Apple's M3 chip, a lightweight and sleek form factor, and all the integrations that make MacBooks the powerhouse laptops they are.

Right now, during Amazon's Prime Big Deals Days event, you can snag a MacBook Air with the M3, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for just $1,249, which is $250 off the regular price. 

Apple's M3 has some of the most efficient chip architecture on the market, making that 16GB of RAM go a lot further than on other lower-end machines, especially for an ultraportable laptop that weighs only 2.7 pounds and is 0.44 inches thick.

The M3 brings processing power and battery life improvements over Apple's previous M2 chip, and at the center of all the advancements is the chip's AI readiness with a 16-core neural engine. The chip also powers the laptop in ways that hybrid and remote workers will care about: you can connect it to up to two external monitors (with the lid closed) for seamless transition if you're commuting into the office or a home setup. Also, the unified memory provides a smooth, stutter-free experience without any graphical lag that comes as a result of working with multiple monitors.

Don't let the MacBook Air's portable size fool you, though; this thing is a powerhouse. The hardware on board is geared to handle demanding workloads, such as photo editing, and productivity multitasking at home or at work. We went hands-on with the MacBook Air M3 right when it was released, and praised the device for its superior design and upgraded neural engine.

The 16GB/512GB configuration that's on sale is a mid-range spec, and more than enough for work-related tasks that occasionally dip into high-demand. Most importantly, it provides a seamless experience for commuters with its portable form factor and integration with external displays. 

Battery life on the M3 Air is fantastic, with upwards of 15 hours on one charge, more than enough for a few work days without having to worry about power. When it does come time to charge, you've got fast charging capabilities, reducing the need to be tethered to a power outlet.

Even better, the MacBook Air M3 comes in four sleek colorways, all of which are on sale. That means you can grab the device in the iconic silver, space gray, starlight, or midnight. 

This is the lowest price we've seen for a top-tier ultraportable machine that's not even a year old. If you've been looking for a good deal to snag a lightweight and snappy MacBook Air, now is the time, as this price isn't going to stick around forever.
