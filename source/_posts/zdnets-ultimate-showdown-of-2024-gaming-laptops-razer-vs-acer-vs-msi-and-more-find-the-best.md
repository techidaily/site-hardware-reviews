## Best of the Best: The Ultimate List of Copilot+ Integrated Gaming and Business Lattices Showcased at IFA 2024

![Dell XPS 13](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/2de5ca69063d3f3d4edbe8284be1c6edb170f2b0/2024/08/29/8de79ff8-75f1-4a1a-8032-53c742a1589a/dell-xps-13-10.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Over the past several months, we've had the opportunity to try out several [Copilot+ PCs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-copilot-pc-microsoft-just-announced-to-take-on-apples-m3-macbooks/) and have liked every single one in one way or another. These laptops run on new AI-powered hardware, resulting in improved performance and battery longevity than older [Windows](https://www.zdnet.com/topic/windows/) machines. We haven't encountered one that we'd consider disappointing.

**Also: [Your next laptop may be powered by this Intel AI chip, and the benefits are mind-blowing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/your-next-laptop-may-be-powered-by-this-intel-ai-chip-and-the-benefits-are-mind-blowing/)**

Imagine our delight when multiple tech companies announced new Copilot+ laptops at [IFA 2024 in Berlin](https://www.ifa-berlin.com/). Some of them are manufacturers expanding their [Copilot](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-copilot-surface-devices-are-finally-coming-to-business-users-heres-whats-new/)\+ offerings, while others are brand new to the scene. So far, about 20 models have been unveiled. There were so many that I might have even miscounted there. For the sake of brevity, the five below are the most interesting of the bunch.

## 1\. Dell XPS 13

Cesar Cadenas/ZDNET

Dell revealed it is relaunching its [XPS 13 laptop](https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-9041660-15815779-1715964270000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), which will now house Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite chipset. It's already available for pre-order at a discounted $999\. The device possesses all of the great features the series is known for, such as the lattice-style keyboard and gorgeous display. This time, it'll have an NPU to enhance the user experience and also have a battery life of up to 27 hours.

What's particularly great is that it is cheaper than the Intel Core Ultra Series 1 model. Thanks to Qualcomm's hardware, the revamped XPS 13 will most likely perform at a similar level to the older laptop, which every user can appreciate.

## 2\. Acer TravelMate P6 14 AI

Acer/ZDNET

Acer came out the gate strongly, announcing four Copilot+ PCs before IFA even began. What caught our eye was the [TravelMate P6 14 AI](https://news.acer.com/acer-launches-new-travelmate-p6-14-ai-leading-the-market-with-copilot-pcs-under-1kg). It's an ultra-lightweight laptop that aims to be a frequent traveler's best friend. The TravelMate weighs just a little over two pounds and measures about half an inch thick when closed. 

**Also: [The best lightweight laptops of 2024: Expert tested](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-lightweight-laptops/)**

To ensure it can fit inside bags, Acer gave this laptop a friendly 14-inch WQXGA Plus (2880 x 1800 pixels) display. The glass is surrounded by thin bezels and supports a 100% sRGB color gamut. Together, the two features enable "outstanding picture quality," the company says. While this model won't be powered by Qualcomm hardware, it instead leverages Intel's new Core Ultra Series 2 processor, and we're excited to see how that fares.

## 3\. Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360

Samsung/ZDNET

Samsung is also getting into the fray, with the tech giant revealing its first Galaxy Book 5 entry: the [Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fgalaxybooks%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1). It's a convertible laptop with what the company calls its "most premium PC display." The Book 5 Pro 360 has a Dynamic AMOLED 2X touchscreen, which is supported by Vision Booster for "improving outdoor visibility and reducing glare." The display can output 3K image resolution and run at a refresh rate of 120Hz.

**Also: [I tested Samsung's new Copilot+ PC, and it's one of the best Windows laptop deals right now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-samsungs-new-copilot-pc-and-its-one-of-the-best-windows-laptop-deals-right-now/)**

The Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 will possess one of the upcoming Intel Core Ultra Series 2 processors. Samsung is planning to inject its own AI tech into the laptop, such as Live Translate, Circle to Search, and Chat Assist.

## 4\. Asus ProArt PZ13

Asus/ZDNET

Asus, like Acer, revealed many models leading up to IFA 2024, but the most fascinating is the [ProArt PZ13](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fasus-proart-pz13-13-3k-detachable-laptop-copilot-pc-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-plus-16gb-memory-1tb-ssd-nano-black%2F6585178.p%3FskuId%3D6585178&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1). It is a detachable laptop for artists on the go, with vibes similar to that of [Microsoft's Surface Pro 11](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-tablet-i-recommend-most-for-business-travel-is-not-an-ipad-or-thinkpad/). It features the company's Lumina OLED touchscreen, supporting "stylus input," and boasts stunning visual fidelity. 

The ProArt PZ13 can output 3K resolution images, much like the Galaxy Book 5 model. Plus, it is Pantone Validation certified, allowing it to showcase realistic-looking colors and skin tones. Unlike previous ProArt models, Asus is notably more budget-friendly, starting at $1,099.

## 5\. MSI Stealth 16 AI Plus

MSI/ZDNET

We've been wondering when someone was going to create a Copilot+ gaming laptop. It appears MSI is leading the charge by unveiling the [Stealth A16 AI Plus](https://www.msi.com/Laptop/Stealth-A16-AI-plus). The brand isn't choosing Qualcomm or Intel for the Stealth A16's processor. Instead, it's opted for the new AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 CPU.

The chipset comes equipped with an NPU capable of reaching 50 TOPS, up from the 45 TOPS of most other Copilot+ PCs. MSI also pairs the Stealth A16 AI Plus with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series graphics card. Even if you're not a big gamer, MSI points out that you can use the Stealth A16 AI Plus for content creation, with the NPU able to be utilized across popular creative apps.
