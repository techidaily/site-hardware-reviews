## How did we choose these wireless earbuds?

ZDNET experts tested and extensively used each product on this list based on battery life and sweat/dust/waterproof claims. While everyone's ears are different, we've weeded out the worst earbuds to bring you the best. Plus, this list features versatile earbuds, so you can find a pair that works for your flexible lifestyle. 

## Should I get wireless earbuds or wireless headphones?

The answer to this depends on what you want -- earbuds and headphones may both deliver the audio quality you're looking for, but the experience of wearing one over the other is the deciding factor. Earbuds go inside the ear, so while you may have a smaller, more compact, and less expensive listening experience, you could run the risk of earwax buildup. Headphones are bulkier and more expensive, and sweat could build up when you wear them for a while. They each have pros and cons.

**More:** [Earbuds vs headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/earbuds-vs-headphones/)

## Which wireless earbuds have the best sound quality?

Each of the wireless earbuds above advertises superior sound quality, but the Apple AirPods 2 have the best sound quality we've heard. The customizable tips create an acoustic seal of sound, Personalized Spatial Audio tracks your head movements as you listen, and you get 30 total hours of listening time with the charging case.

## Active vs passive noise cancellation, what's the difference?

With passive noise cancellation, ear cups or earbuds keep surrounding noise out. There's a physical seal against background noise. Active noise cancellation incorporates the microphones and speakers, or the interior of the earbuds or headphones, to diminish unwanted noise.

## Which brand is best for wireless earbuds?

Apple has the best wireless earbuds on the market, the AirPods 2nd generation, which sets itself apart from the rest in audio quality, noise cancelation, and battery life.

## Are there alternative wireless earbuds worth considering?

There are plenty of wireless earbuds on the market right now. Here are a few other options to consider:
