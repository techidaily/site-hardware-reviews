## Score Big Savings This Black Friday with a Steal of a Deal on Dell XPS 15 Laptops - Save up to $700 | Tech News

![Dell XPS 15](https://www.zdnet.com/a/img/resize/d2998699facad3555f0edb6f1e3025671ba838fb/2022/11/04/c661e0ca-2402-40f7-a56d-c6e2f14c96df/dell-xps-15.jpg?auto=webp&width=1280)

Getting a premium laptop usually comes with an equally premium price tag. However, there's a really good deal right now at Dell if you're in the market for a new laptop: the [Dell XPS 15 laptop](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F9041660%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fzd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fproductdetail%2Ffl56). Currently, you can save $800 on the laptop right now, bringing the price from $2,899 to $2,199\.

When ZDNET reviewed Dell's XPS 15 in [2020](https://www.zdnet.com/product/dell-xps-15-9500/), we described it as setting "a new high bar' for 15.6-inch laptops," while the [2021](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dell-xps-15-9510-its-good-to-be-king/) model was dubbed "the standard against which other laptops are measured." Clearly, it still carries a premium price tag, even with $700 shaved off the list price, but you're getting a top-notch configuration that will suit a wide range of demanding professionals.
