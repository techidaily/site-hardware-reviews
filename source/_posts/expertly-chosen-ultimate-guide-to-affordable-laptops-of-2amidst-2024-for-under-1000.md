My pick for the best laptop under $1,000 overall is the [M2 MacBook Air](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Midnight%2Fdp%2FB0CB73MSX4%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6d1dd109-1447-4f5a-8340-382144317f59%7Cdtp&dtb=1), thanks to its solid performance, portability, and HD display. With the March release of the [M3 MacBook Air](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m3-macbook-air-review/), the previous M2 model received a price cut.

With this in mind, check out my top picks for the best laptops under $1,000.

## Apple M2 MacBook Air

### Best laptop under $1,000 overall

The best laptop under $1,000 overall is the M2 MacBook Air, which was also named [ZDNET's Product of the Year for 2022](https://www.zdnet.com/article/m2-macbook-air-zdnets-product-of-the-year/). It's a fantastic machine for a variety of reasons. The M2 SoC (system on a chip) gives the device a much-needed performance boost. It lets you quickly transfer enormous files, render videos, compress them, and create multimedia-intense PowerPoints. The M2 MacBook Air can do all of this without blinking.

Professional and casual users alike will appreciate the Liquid Retina display, which can simultaneously show 1.07 billion shades of color. Granted, it may not be as stunning as the screen on the MacBook Pro, but you still get a roughly 2K resolution image (2,560 x 1,664 pixels). Having a screen this nice does come at a cost. The M2 MacBook Air has a slightly worse battery life than the 2020 model, lasting about 16 hours instead of 17 hours. 

**Review: [Apple MacBook Air (M2, 2022)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review/)**

Despite the slightly short battery life, the device is a premiere laptop, no matter how you look at it. As ZDNET's editor-in-chief Jason Hiner wrote in his hands-on review, "the M2 MacBook Air is... the first redesign of the... product line in over a decade, and Apple has delivered a hardware design that impresses" on both form and function.

### Best 2-in-1 laptop under $1,000

2-in-1 laptops offer unique utility due to their flexibility: one minute, you could use it as a traditional laptop typing away on the keyboard, and the next, you'd be drawing on it like a tablet after flipping the display around. Their form factor allows them to tackle all sorts of workloads. Among the low-cost options, the Lenovo Yoga 7i is the best.

The Yoga 7i's success is due to three factors: its hardware, its display, and its design. First, the device houses the decently powerful Intel Core Ultra 5 alongside 16GB of RAM, making it robust and speedy enough to handle a wide array of tasks easily. Additionally, it offers a good amount of storage courtesy of its 512GB SSD.

**Also: [Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-699-lenovo-laptop-made-me-a-believer-in-the-2-in-1-form-factor-and-its-on-sale-for-memorial-day/)**

Regarding its display, you'll receive a 16-inch Full HD touchscreen. ZDNET Editor Kyle Kucharski referred to it as "dynamic... \[adding\] another dimension to Windows" and allowing "flexible usage." 

However, it is not particularly bright, maxing out at 300 nits (you're better off not using this laptop under the sun). Design-wise, Lenovo made several great choices: It's slim yet durable, and the hinges feel particularly strong, minimizing screen wobble.

### Best 14-inch laptop under $1,000

Bigger doesn't always mean better. Sometimes people overlook 14-inch laptops because they don't look as aesthetically impressive as larger machines. But you may be surprised at how fantastic they can be, and in certain scenarios, be way better than 16-inch laptops. Dell's Inspiron 14 Plus 7440 is one of these computers.

It's a hardy little device sporting a compact 14-inch display and a form factor made out of aluminum and recycled steel. You may think the Inspiron 14 Plus 7440 weighs a ton with all that metal, but quite the contrary. It clocks in at around 3.5 pounds for ease of carrying. This is an ideal machine for users who are frequently on the go.

**Review: [I tested Dell's most underrated laptop and it has clever features at an accessible price](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-dells-most-underrated-laptop-and-it-has-clever-features-at-an-accessible-price/)**

Under the hood, the Inspiron 14 Plus 7440 runs on an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, plus an Intel Arc graphics card. It's a pairing well-known for great all-around performance, although it does struggle with demanding tasks. The laptop's battery can last a little over eight hours which is good enough for a full day's work. Of course, that number can extend when you enable the battery saver, for example, to enjoy the device a bit longer.

We can't forget the wonderful onboard keyboard. Each key is made out of a rubber-like material that's soft to the touch. Combine that with the springy keys and you have a very comfortable keyboard.

## HP Pavilion Plus

### Best screen for a laptop under $1,000

Being a budget laptop doesn't necessarily mean you have to offer a subpar experience. Case in point: the HP Pavilion Plus, which has a fantastic screen. It starts strong, as the base model houses a 1,920 x 1,200 pixel resolution IPS (in-plane switching) display. An IPS screen is notable because it outputs more color and has better viewing angles than an LED display. 

One step above that, you have the WQXGA options, which outputs at a resolution of 2,560 x 1,600 pixels. Not only is it an IP screen, but it's also covered in an anti-glare coating to ensure clarity. And it's been certified for Low Blue Light to keep your eye from getting tired of staring at a screen all day. Then, at the top, HP offers a stunning 2.8K resolution OLED screen. This is the cream of the crop as the option can show off a vibrant array of colors and abyssal blacks in high quality.

The problem with the OLED option is that it is the most expensive of the three. It requires you to get the AMD Ryzen 7 7840U processor, increasing the cost of the laptop to over $800\. It is still relatively cheap compared to other OLED laptops, but it may be out of budget for some people. Regardless of the price, the Pavilion Plus is a great device.

### Best value laptop under $1,000

The Acer Aspire 3 has earned its spot as the best laptop for value. It's the cheapest option here and serves as a solid work machine. The device has an AMD Ryzen 3 7320U processor, an integrated AMD Radeon graphics card, and 8GB of RAM. It's a lightweight laptop that can handle various tasks, from internet browsing to writing documents and streaming movies. Due to its mid-range hardware, the Aspire 3's battery can last quite a while – about 11 hours on a single charge, according to Acer. You should know the 

If you check out the Amazon reviews for the laptop, you'll notice many people like the display. The summary explicitly points out that users enjoy how it "provides crisp visuals and vibrant colors." That's probably because Acer gave their model a 15.6-inch Full HD resolution (1,920 x 1,080 pixels) IPS display. 

Like the previous Pavilion Plus, IPS tech allows the computer to show vibrant colors. It even supports Acer BlueLightShield, which lowers the amount of harmful blue light sent to your eyes. Another great feature worth mentioning is its large cooling fan, which ensures the model is at an optimal temperature at all times.

## Asus Vivobook 15

### Best work laptop under $1,000

On the surface, the Asus Vivobook 15 looks pretty unassuming. It just seems like your average everyday work laptop; nothing special. That may be the case to a certain extent, but this device is a highly capable, low budget machine sure to outshine its rivals. 

Asus sells this model across multiple configurations and they're all cheap. We highly recommend getting the Vivobook 15 with a whopping 40GB of RAM and the 1TB SSD. Having that amount of memory will make multitasking a breeze. You will pratically never have to worry about your computer slowing down during peak workloads. Apps will run faster, the Vivobook can highly intensive tasks, and speedier internet browsing. 

The laptop also has an interesting ErgoLift design meaning the display lifts the computer up when opened. This does two important things. First, it forces the keyboard to sit as a slanted angle allowing for comfortable typing. And second, it ensures good airflow so the heat coming out of the bottom vents has a place to go and isn't trapped underneath.

As mentioned earlier, you ave multiple options. If you want extra storage, the Vivobook 15 is available in a 2TB configuration. For those of you who want to save extra money, Asus offers lesser configuration at a lower price. Don't worry about missing out on memory. The other laptops have a good amount of RAM for workloads.

## Microsoft Surface Pro 9

### Best graphic design laptop

Graphic designs laptops tend to be expensive, as the work they're intended for often requires powerful hardware -- which can be pricey. Microsoft's Surface Pro 9 bucks this trend by being a low-cost design laptop that won't cost you an arm or a leg. 

Truth be told, the Surface Pro 9 is more of a tablet than a traditional laptop. You interact with it via the Slim Pen 2, which is primarily used for drawing on the touchscreen, although it can be used for navigation. Speaking of which, it comes equipped with a stunning 13-inch PixelSense Flow Display capable of outputting impressive color accuracy. 

Plus, it runs at a refresh rate of 120Hz for velvety smooth animations. Putting these two features together allow the Surface Pro 9 to be an effective "on-the-go Photoshop workstation." And like other Microsoft Surface models, you can equip it with the Signature Keyboard accessory to turn it into a proper laptop.

**Review: [Microsoft Surface Pro 9 review: The MacBook competitor Windows users have been waiting for](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-surface-pro-9-review/)**

Performance-wise, the Surface Pro 9 does pretty well. Buyers originally have the option to purchase an ARM-based chipset. Though the only processor available for the device at the time of writing is the 12th generation Intel Core i5\. That's totally fine because the Intel CPU was arguably the better of the two. It enables the laptop to be "exceptional work machine."

## Which is the right laptop under $1,000 for you?

The best laptop is the one that meets your needs. There isn't a one-size-fits-all computer. The MacBook Air, as great as it is, is a bad pick for people who want a gaming laptop. Mac hardware just isn't built for that. Small laptops aren't recommended for those who are looking for a large screen.

Read the chart below to find out which device works best for you.

## Factors to consider when choosing a laptop under $1,000:

A great laptop doesn't have to cost a fortune. To determine the best laptops under $1,000, there are several factors you need to consider.

* **CPU** **Model**: A good processor allows your computer to complete workloads quickly and understand the task at hand. Look for a newer processor boasting faster speeds to guarantee a high-performing machine.
* ****RAM Memory:** Consider how much memory you will need for your computer. If you deal with a lot of files, you'll need more RAM than the average user.
* **Screen size:** It's usually a matter of preference when it comes to picking out the best screen size. Laptops under $1,000 tend to have small display screens, ranging from 12.3 inches to 15.6 inches. It is possible to find laptops that are both bigger and smaller than this specific range.
* **Price:** Cost is, of course, the most important factor here, so pay attention to that price tag. We find that the best devices range between $500 to $800, depending on the make and model you choose.

## How did we test these laptops?

Here at ZDNET, we receive many laptops to check out and review. So, it's important we separate the best from the rest. To do this, we follow the guidelines in the previous question. We look at the device's processor, memory, screen size, and cost. From there, the laptops are tested for quality. We run labor-intensive apps to see how well they perform.

**Also:** [**How we test laptops**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-laptops/)

Once all that is done, we come to a consensus on the best ones that will suit a wide variety of customers and use cases and round them up in a best list, like the one you're reading right now.

To learn more about our laptop testing process, be sure to visit [this extensive article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-laptops/) on the topic. 

## Which laptop brand is the best and cheapest?

There isn't a specific brand that is best or the cheapest. It varies a lot of the time. One company might have the best low-cost laptop this year, and in the next year, it'll be another company. That said, there are several brands you should look out for when purchasing a cheap laptop; namely Dell, Acer, Asus, and Lenovo. Models from these frequently show up on this list because they're among the best.

You'll occasionally see a great low-cost device from other famous brands like Apple or lesser known companies. However those deals are rarer. If you want a particular MacBook for example, you'll have to wait until the following year after it releases to see a discount.

## Which laptop brand has the least problems?

Longevity is an important factor to consider when purchasing a laptop. You don't need to sacrifice quality for an inexpensive machine. A low-cost computer can last just as long, if not longer, than a more expensive one.

Research has been done to determine the most reliable laptop brands out there. As it turns out, [Asus ranks high](https://ticktocktech.com/blog/2023/03/31/10-most-reliable-laptop-brands-for-2023/) on several lists. The brand is lauded for equipping their machines with sturdy designs, "strengthened hinges, and shock-resistant hard drives." Of course, they're also lightweight and powerful. The [US Public Interest Research Group](https://pirg.org/articles/best-laptops-of-2024-the-most-repairable-laptops-and-why-it-matters/) (PIRG) even found Asus to be one of the best brands in terms of repairability in 2024.

Other notable laptop companies include Dell, Microsoft, and Acer.

## How do you know when you need a new laptop?

Most people would say that you need to replace a laptop when you begin to experience performance degradation. That is certainly one factor you should look for, however it's possible you're simply behind on your software updates. In this case, we recommend merely installing your computer's latest patches to bring up to snuff.

There are other factors to consider, such as constant errors. Constant crashes and random restarts are signs that the hard drive is failing. Additionally, exceptionally loud cooling fans are another sign that the device is nearing its final days. You can certainly try to fix the laptop yourself, but you'll need a lot of experience in computer repair to get things done right -- or risk damaging the hardware. You're better off buying a new machine.

## Can a Chromebook do everything a laptop can?

Chromebooks offer a great series of low-cost laptops that several third-party manufacturers create. They don't run on any Windows operating system instead opting for ChromeOS. These devices are generally less expensive than laptops, can perform similarly to a Windows machine, and have a long battery life. Chromebooks require very little maintenance as they don't primarily utilize on-device software.

They're a great option for people who are on a budget. However, there is a distinct downside to owning a Chromebook, and it's that they require constant internet access to work properly. The thing about these machines is many of the functions run on Google's cloud servers. If you're ever away from an internet connection or the service is down you won't be able to use a Chromebook to its fullest extent.

Additionally, Chromebooks have limited storage space and processing power compared to laptops.

## What time of year do laptops go on sale?

The laptops in the list go for under $1,000 consistently. However, finding other devices that go below this price point during big sales is possible. These tend to occur on major holidays or sales events like the 4th of July and Memorial Day. Of course, computers can sell for pennies during the year's biggest sales weekend: Black Friday going into Cyber Monday.

There are a few other times of the year when you can score discounts on devices. Depending on the company, manufacturers may slash prices during the beginning of the year or around October. It's around this time that manufacturers are preparing to launch their new generation of hardware or have already done so. MacBooks, for example, can go for pretty cheap during this time. 

## Are there alternative laptops under $1,000 worth considering?

Absolutely. There are a ton of cheap laptops out there. We could have included more, but for the sake of brevity, we kept the list short. Below are a few more choices from big-name brands worth your consideration.
