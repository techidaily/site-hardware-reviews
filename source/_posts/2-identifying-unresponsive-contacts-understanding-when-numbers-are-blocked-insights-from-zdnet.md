Most of us remember getting those calls -- "Your car's warranty is about to expire..." -- whether we have a car or not. Aside from going to [DoNotCall.gov](https://www.donotcall.gov/) or calling 1-888-382-1222 to be added to a do-not-call list, you can also block specific phone numbers from your phone.

But what if you need to block someone you know, like a coworker, a neighbor, or an old flame? Can the person you've blocked tell that you've blocked them? It's complicated, so we'll walk you through the various ways that someone _may_ be able to tell if their number has been blocked.

## Can someone tell if I block their number?

First things first: If you block someone's number, they won't find out right away, if at all. They won't get a notification saying they were blocked and they won't be able to see the block (plainly) anywhere -- but they _can_ infer and assume they've been blocked. How? The two simple ways a person can figure out if they've been blocked are by sending you texts and calling you. 

## 1\. Sending you a text

If you and the person you blocked both use iPhones, your text message exchange is through iMessage, so the messages show up in blue.

This text is delivered as an iMessage so it comes up in blue and says Delivered, which means your number isn't blocked

If they are not blocked and decide to send you a text message, that send message would appear blue and say "Delivered."

Several text message changes can be clues to the other person that they may have blocked:

* If the text message looks green, it was sent as an SMS instead of an iMessage
* If the sender sees "Not Delivered" in red under the green text bubble
* If the message goes through as an iMessage but does not show that it was 'Delivered'

These changes can all be clues to the other person they may have blocked.

However, an iMessage also can appear in green -- or not show as "Delivered" -- when someone's phone is turned off or doesn't have a signal or internet connection. Therefore, the other party may assume something like that has happened rather than immediately concluding that they've been blocked. 

## 2\. If the blocked number calls yours

When someone thinks they're blocked, it's all about putting the pieces together to determine if the other person has blocked their number. When you call someone who hasn't blocked your number, you typically hear several rings before their phone goes to voicemail.

When you call a number that has blocked yours, you may hear a single ring, half a ring, or even no rings at all, and then the call will go right to voicemail. However, a block is not the only possible reason for a call going right to voicemail. Perhaps their phone is turned off or out of range, or perhaps they've temporarily turned on 'Do Not Disturb' mode to work, drive, or sleep.

If the person you blocked calls your number, they'll go to voicemail and can leave a message, but you won't get a missed call or voicemail notification.

If the "Someone" you blocked calls your number, they'll probably go straight to voicemail

## 3\. They may hide their number

If the blocked party's messages are delivered as text when they used to be iMessages and their calls consistently go straight to voicemail, they may try calling you from a different number or hiding their number. They can hide their number by dialing \*67 before your phone number, and the call will come in as No Caller ID.

If the blocked caller gets through from a different number or by hiding their number, then they'll probably be pretty certain you have blocked them.

For my peace of mind, I wouldn't answer No Caller ID calls after blocking someone unless I was expecting an important call.

If you're the person that's been blocked, keep in mind that although no one wants to find themselves being blocked by another person, especially if it's someone you care about, the best thing to do is to allow that person the privacy and time to process their needs for doing so.

## FAQs

## Can someone tell if I blocked their number on Android?  

Android is not as straightforward as iPhone when it comes to figuring out if someone blocked you. Since there is no iMessage in Android, it's a little trickier to determine. Some phones offer read and delivered receipts, so if that's the case for yours and the blocked person's phone and they're not seeing the receipts, they may try doing some digging.

Either way, if their calls to your number don't go through and they hide their number to call you and do get through, they will likely figure out you blocked their number regardless of delivered or read receipts.

## Does blocking a phone number block it on WhatsApp?  

When you block someone's number, you won't receive their calls, texts, or voicemail notifications. However, if you also use WhatsApp to communicate, their number won't be automatically blocked on the messaging app. 

WhatsApp works independently of your phone manufacturer and provider. Within the app, you can block someone from contacting you via WhatsApp.

Going to the contact info in WhatsApp and tapping on Block (this person) will do the trick.

## How do I know if someone blocked me on WhatsApp?  

If you think someone has blocked you on WhatsApp, you can message them to check. When someone receives a WhatsApp message, two checks will show up when it's been delivered, and they'll turn blue when it's been read. If only one gray checkmark comes up, the message hasn't been delivered to the recipient.

It may not be delivered if that person isn't connected to the internet or their phone is off. If you have other reasons to think they might have blocked you on WhatsApp, give it a couple of days, and if the checkmark never doubles, they probably have.

## Can someone tell if I block their number on a landline?

If you're getting unwanted calls on your landline, you may wonder if someone can tell if you've blocked their number, whether you did it with a call blocker or through your phone carrier. The blocked party won't get a notification that they've been blocked, but if they call your landline, they may hear a busy signal or a message that their call couldn't go through or that the number is busy. The response they hear will depend on the carrier. 

**Also: [I decluttered my iPhone and freed up gigs of space. Here's how](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-decluttered-my-iphone-and-freed-up-gigs-of-space-heres-how/)**

The blocked caller can't leave a voicemail on a landline like they'd be able to when blocked on your iPhone, for example. Their call simply won't go through.
