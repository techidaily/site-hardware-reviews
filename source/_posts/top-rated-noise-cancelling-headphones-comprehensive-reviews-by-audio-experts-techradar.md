## Top Rated Noise-Cancelling Headphones : Comprehensive Reviews by Audio Experts | TechRadar

As someone who reviews products for a living, I've tested the best noise-canceling earbuds on the market in every possible scenario, whether that's when the office gets too loud at work, when the subway commute is overstimulating, and when my upstairs neighbor's music is loud. I also wear them when I'm reading and want no environmental or sound distractions, because the best noise-canceling earbuds don't just deliver tunes that sound good -- they also offer up sweet, sweet silence when no music is playing.

Active noise cancellation (ANC) is a highly coveted feature in the earbud market right now. With the help of [tiny microphones on the earbuds' exterior](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-do-noise-canceling-headphones-work/), ANC earbuds actively listen to cancel out incoming sound waves, preserving quiet and amplifying in-ear sound. But, no matter how strong a pair's noise-canceling powers are, it's important they don't have connectivity problems or major sound leakage issues.

* Bose earbuds tend to lose connection

### Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds

#### Best noise-canceling earbuds overall

My upstairs neighbor is a Brooklyn DJ who has been mixing and editing the same song for months on end. How do I know? Because his speakers are so loud that I can hear his every edit from the floor below. I put in the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds when I'm trying to read and focus on my book, and not on the noise from that talented mixmaster, the honks and beeps of car horns outside my window, nor the roommate conversations happening in the kitchen. I don't put on any music -- the noise cancellation on these earbuds is so good that every sound dissolves once these are in my ears, so I can read and think in peace. I also strictly rely on these earbuds when I fly, because I haven't found another earbud that dims the harsh engine noises of air travel the way these do. 

**Review:** [**Forget AirPods Pro: These Bose noise-canceling earbuds sound better and feel premium**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/forget-airpods-pro-these-bose-noise-cancelling-earbuds-sound-better-and-feel-premium/)

As far as music goes, the QuietComfort Ultra delivers impressive, wide-ranging sound. On runs, these earbuds stick in my ears, which I can credit to the oval shape of the ear tip and the extra grip from the stability band. 

Another notable feature is Bose's Immersive Audio mode, which brings music to the forefront of your ears and allows music to move with you. It's a great feature, but it does significantly reduce battery life. Speaking of which, the battery life on these isn't the most competitive at only six hours, but the case provides extra juice for on-the-go charging when you need it. 

One issue that is common on Reddit threads and in reviews is Bose's connectivity problems. The earbuds have a tendency to lose connection. I've found that adequately charging the buds prevents these connection losses. Other people recommend deleting the app, which can be buggy. 

**Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds specs:** **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.3 | **Battery life:** 6 hours | **Frequency range:** NA | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Waterproof rating:** Water resistant

* Impressive noise-canceling

Cons 
* Steep-but-worth-it price
* Reviewers don't like the ear tips

### Sony WF-1000XM5

#### Best noise-canceling earbuds for sound quality

The Sony WF-1000XM5 earbuds are the best in the game for sound quality, and according to ZDNET reviews writer Jada Jones, cancel out noise like a pair of over-ear headphones. Jones calls them "as good as true wireless noise-canceling earbuds come," and you should take her word for it. And reviewers on Reddit agree, complimenting the competitive noise cancellation that beats Apple's AirPods Pro 2\. 

"With them on, gone are the extraneous noises at the gym, including sounds of overused machines, dropped weights, background music, and people talking," Jones writes in her review. 

**Review:** [**These are the best premium earbuds on the market right now**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonys-new-wf-1000xm5-may-just-be-the-best-premium-earbuds-right-now/)

This model is lighter and smaller than the Sony WF-1000XM4 earbuds, according to reviews. The battery life is up to 12 hours long, and the upgraded ear tips create a suction that seals noise into the ears and blocks out any background noise. Even with that strong suction, the earbuds are still comfortable enough to wear all day long, according to Jones (although some Amazon reviews say that the Bose QuietComfort earbuds are far more comfortable). 

**Sony WF 1000XM5 tech specs: Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.3 | **Battery life:** Up to 12 hours | **Frequency range:** 2.4 GHz - 2.48 GHz | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Waterproof rating:** IPX4 (resistant to water splashes)

### Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)

#### Best noise-canceling earbuds with Apple compatibility

AirPods, now iconic, have come a long way from skeptics just thinking of them as a cordless version of Apple's classic . But Apple's design of the AirPods Pro ushered in an impressive combination of excellent sound quality, comfort, and noise-canceling capabilities -- especially with the 2nd generation.

Thanks to Apple's new H2 chip, these AirPods significantly upgrade performance via high-band connectivity and a low-distortion audio driver with a custom amplifier. These combined technologies ensure clearer audio across a wider range of sound frequencies.

And for those that find constant noise cancellation a tad disorienting, these 2nd-generation AirPods Pro have a transparency mode that ZDNET contributor Jason Cipriani [says](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACsbPIyr0NM) he is "legitimately in love with," based on high-quality audio and surrounding sound listening. 

**Also:** [**Two new AirPods models are expected this fall. Here's what we know**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-new-airpods-models-expected-this-fall-heres-everything-we-know-so-far/)

These new AirPods feature two times more noise cancellation with a 33% longer battery life. Plus, a new feature allows you to personalize spatial audio settings to create your ideal sound experience (using iOS 16). To top it all off (literally), you can quickly charge the 2nd-generation AirPods Pro case wirelessly via an Apple Watch charger.

Reviewers on Reddit loved using the AirPods Pro 2 on their flights to cancel out engine noise, and said they can't hear most of the noises around them with these earbuds in. 

**Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) features** **:** **Battery life:** Six hours | **Waterproof rating:** IPX4 | **Earbud weight:** 5.3 g each | **Wireless charging:** Yes

Pros 
* Great battery life
* Impressive noise-canceling
* Convenient touchscreen case

Cons 
* Heavy case
* Earbuds tend to insecurely fit during intense, sweaty exercise sessions
* Gimmicky touchscreen case

Battery life  Rated up to 8 hours

### JBL Tour Pro 2

#### Best mid-priced earbuds

I was waiting at the subway platform the first morning I tried these earbuds out. While looking down at my phone with my JBL Tour Pro 2 earbuds in and the noise cancellation on, I barely registered the subway's arrival. These earbuds offer impressive noise cancellation, long battery life, and dual connectivity. 

The Tour Pro 2 is less expensive than some of the higher end noise canceling earbuds on this list, like Sony's WF-1000XM4 and Bose's QuietComfort Ultra, and they offer a longer battery life than Apple's AirPods Pro but go for the same price. So if you're looking to spend a little money on a good pair but don't want to dive into the above-$300 range, these could be for you. 

They're very comfortable to wear in the office or while exercising, though they don't have the strongest grip in your ears. I've found myself running in the park with them in and constantly having to re-secure them. The ambient aware mode is pretty useless -- and Reddit users agree with one saying it left "much to be desired," but that's alright, because the active noise cancellation is the real winner.

Some Reddit users say the touchscreen case is more gimmicky than utilitarian, but most users agree on the earbuds' high quality noise cancellation and decent sound for the price. 

**JBL Tour Pro 2 tech specs:** **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.3 | **Battery life:** 8 hours with ANC on and 10 hours with ANC off | **Frequency range:** 20 Hz - 20 kHz | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Waterproof rating:** IPX5

Pros 
* Long battery life
* Bluetooth Multipoint
* Great sound
* Amazing ANC

Cons 
* No in-ear detection
* Touch controls aren't great

### JLab Jbuds ANC 3

#### Best budget noise-canceling earbuds

The JLab JBuds ANC 3 prove that you don't have to spend loads of money on a pair of earbuds to get competitive active noise cancellation. As I write in the Bose QuietComfort section above, I have an upstairs neighbor who is constantly mixing music at such high volume my apartment walls begin to shake. Working in my apartment can become a hassle with such distracting sounds. But when I wear these earbuds, the loud music from upstairs melts away, similar to the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, but a fraction of the price. 

The JLab Jbuds ANC 3 offer three listening modes: ANC, ANC Off, and Be Aware. The ANC mode dims down and distances external sound as I listen to audio, and is competitive with some of the more premium earbuds I've tried, for a fraction of the price. Plus, the battery life lasted me weeks before I had to recharge, so if you're someone who can't devote to daily or even weekly charging, try these out. 

Given how lightweight the buds are, they also fit snugly and comfortably in my ears, and, most importantly, stay in them while I exercise. With a long battery life, multipoint Bluetooth for easy audio switching between devices, and great sound, these are an excellent choice for $60 earbuds. 

Verified reviewers on Amazon say that the noise cancellation and sound on these earbuds is legit, but the earbuds lack in special features, like easy touch controls on the earbuds. 

**JLab JBuds ANC 3** **tech specs: Connectivity:** Bluetooth Multipoint | **Battery life:** 9 hours in the earbuds and 33+ hours in the case | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Waterproof?** IP55

### Sennheiser Accentum True Wireless Earbuds

#### Best noise-canceling earbud for audiophiles

For how many premium features Sennheiser packs into these earbuds, you'd think they cost more than $200, but they don't. ZDNET's Jack Wallen took the Accentum True Wireless earbuds out for a spin and was thoroughly impressed by how exceptional the sound was, right out of the box, with no in-app EQ adjustments. Plus, you can wear these earbuds all day without any issues of comfort. "The Accentum buds have a natural and relaxed fit, and they feel as comfortable when you take them out as they did when you first put them in," Wallen writes. 

Wallen also lauded the impressive noise cancellation the earbuds sported. "The ANC on these earbuds is fantastic. As soon as the music started playing, all sounds were drowned out and it was just me and the tunes. This ANC beats every pair of earbuds I've tested to date," he adds. 

I'd recommend these $200 earbuds to people who care about competitive sound quality who are looking for a good pair of noise-canceling earbuds, but don't want to spend premium earbud-level money on them (that is, over $300).

## Factors to consider when choosing a pair of noise-canceling earbuds:

As a commerce editor who specializes in earbuds and wearables, I test out a lot of headphones and earbuds in my day-to-day to see which products live up to their promises. So, while deciding which noise-canceling earbuds are worth your money, I considered these factors. 

* **Noise cancellation**: In essence, every earbud could be a noise-canceling earbud, because the job of a headphone or an earbud is to cancel noise by replacing it with music or another sound. We see that term attached to every headphone and earbud on the market today, but many earbuds lack the technology and the needed microphones to drown out external sound and deliver true ANC. The best noise-canceling earbuds that we have tested cancel out noise even when music isn't playing. The proof is in the pudding: when you are wearing a pair of true ANC earbuds, you will hear nothing.
* **Battery life:** Earbuds have shorter battery lives compared to headphones, and range between six to 12 hours of juice before a recharge. The earbuds on this list also offer charging cases that charge the earbud while it's not in your ears to lengthen the battery life.
* **Price:** From what I've seen, if you want noise-canceling earbuds that actually work, you normally have to pay a bit of a higher price for them. The earbuds on this list range in price from $60 to $300\. $300, you may think, is a lot for a piece of audio tech, but we wouldn't put an expensive earbud on this list if it didn't truly fit the bill.
* **Special features:** In-ear detection, seamless pause and play controls, and multi-point connection are all special features that come with higher-end noise-canceling earbuds. If you're paying over $200 for a pair of earbuds, you'll find more convenient features like those in your earbuds.

## How did we test these noise-canceling earbuds?

On this list, you will find earbuds that I have either tested out for myself or that have been vetted by one of our experts. We spend days, weeks, and even sometimes months on end testing our products to learn about their performance, features, and usability. Then, we decided whether they live up to the hype. 

For the noise-canceling earbuds on this best list, I ran with them on busy city streets, took meetings and worked with them in the office, read with them to silence external noise at home, and jammed with them on the loud subway. I made my best list selections by considering sound, of course, but also battery life, comfort, connectivity, special features, and user reviews.

When we think a product is worthy of a shoutout, we'll write up a spotlight. When we think a product is the best of the best, we'll give it a spot on a best list like this.

## What are noise-canceling earbuds and how do they work?

Noise-canceling earbuds use active noise cancellation to reduce background noise and improve the overall sound quality of audio. ANC works by using mics to pick up external sounds, and then it generates sound waves that are the exact opposite wavelengths (or "negative" of the external sounds) to create a "cancellation" effect that reduces background noise. 

Some noise-canceling earbuds also use passive noise-cancellation, which is achieved through earbud design, such as using noise-isolating materials. These are particularly useful in environments with high levels of ambient noise, like airplanes or busy streets. They can also provide a better listening experience in general, reducing the need to use max volume to overcome background noise.

## Do noise canceling earbuds protect your hearing?

No, ANC earbuds should not be confused with a hearing protection device, and experts agree.

"Nobody should ever think of them as, in my opinion, pure hearing protection. They're not," says ENT Dr. Joe Donzelli. And while noise-canceling earbuds can offer some passive protection like any sound wave boundary, Dr. Donzelli assures that they don't deter the culprit of hearing loss: Inner ear trauma.

"Everything is all about the sound you're delivering through the headphones, so you can get the greatest noise cancellation ever, but if you just turn up the volume and expose yourself to high decibels for long periods of time, you'll then create inner ear trauma," Donzelli explains.

However, since listening to music at high volume for long periods of time can damage hearing, a good pair of ANC headphones may have some secondary hearing protection benefits.

"If someone is using ANC earbuds to get rid of ambient noise, they may not have to turn the volume up as loud to hear the in-ear sound," Donzelli says.

Essentially, here's how ANC earbuds may help: You find your ANC earbuds effectively cancel out distracting noises. Before, you had to blast the volume just to hear accurately, but thanks to the magic of ANC, the sound is clear at half the volume. Now, you're listening at a lower volume for longer, and therefore likely have less exposure to [damaging decibel levels](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/hearing%5Floss/what%5Fnoises%5Fcause%5Fhearing%5Floss.html#:~:text=Noise%20above%2070%20dB%20over,immediate%20harm%20to%20your%20ears.), which means less inner ear trauma. 

But Donzelli reiterates that the "tighter you put something in your ear and the louder you make it, the more damage. So if somebody runs around with their \[earbuds\] turned up all the way with or without noise cancellation, it doesn't make a difference." 

## Do noise-canceling earbuds cancel all noise? 

Think of your finest pair of noise-canceling earbuds as high end noise reducers -- not complete noise cancellers. It's confusing, but let me explain. 

You've probably tested out a pair of noise-canceling earbuds like Apple's AirPods Pro 2 or Bose's QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, and still heard a little bit of noise and conversation with them in. Noise-canceling earbuds usually cancel low frequency noise, like the hum of an airplane engine, the AC unit in your apartment, or the sounds of the train. You might still hear people talking around you with your earbuds in, but the sounds of conversation will be reduced. 

## Can noise-canceling earbuds damage your hearing?

According to ENT Dr. Joe Donzelli, noise-canceling earbuds alone don't damage your hearing. Long exposure to unhealthy decibel levels is what causes trauma to the [tympanic membrane](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/24642-tympanic-membrane-eardrum), and therefore can damage hearing. 

For reference, the [hearing health foundation](https://hearinghealthfoundation.org/keeplistening/decibels) says that sounds at or below 70dB are considered safe for our hearing and sounds at or above 80-85 dB will damage hearing over time. If you're worried your listening levels are higher than this, you can easily monitor your earbuds' projected decibel levels via your [smartphone settings](https://hearinghealthfoundation.org/keeplistening/decibels). 

## Are noise-canceling earbuds good for sleeping?

Noise-canceling headphones can be great for sleeping or falling asleep, especially for stomach and back sleepers. However, I'll warn that while the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds are sure to cancel any sleep-inhibiting sound, they're a bit chunky -- especially for side sleepers. Also, keep in mind that they're not the best option in the case of an emergency, since you're essentially tuned out to the world.

## Is noise-canceling bad for your ears?

In short, no. Noise cancellation is not bad for your ears. However, some people have experienced dizziness while using noise-canceling modes.

## What can I use my noise-canceling earbuds for?

There are many ways I use my noise-canceling earbuds. Yes, they're great for hearing more out of your music. But you can also use them if you're feeling overstimulated by your environment and need some peace and quiet. I used them during the holidays whenever my family got in a fight I didn't want to listen to. I listen to them in the office when other people are taking conference calls around me and I need to focus. They are an anxious and overstimulated person's best friend. 

One guy on Reddit even used noise-canceling earbuds to tune out his wife in the morning (and an entire morality discussion ensued in the [Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1566rfb/aita%5Ffor%5Fbuying%5Fnoise%5Fcanceling%5Fearbuds%5Fto%5Ftune/)). This is all to say that silence can be valuable, and if it's something you can't get enough of, get a pair of noise-canceling earbuds and see for yourself how much calmer and more productive you can be with them in. 

## Are there alternative noise-canceling earbuds worth considering?

There are over 4,000 search results when you type in, "noise-canceling earbuds" into your Amazon search bar. However, Amazon isn't the only place to secure a new pair of earbuds. You can find them at Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and so many other places! 

Here are a few that didn't make the cut, including some true wireless earbuds, that are great alternatives if the options above don't sound like the best fit for you.
