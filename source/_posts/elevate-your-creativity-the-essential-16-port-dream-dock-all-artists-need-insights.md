Asus/ZDNET

Asus is well-known for its stylish laptops with gorgeous displays, and the [Vivobook Go 15.6-inch laptop](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FASUS-Vivobook-Go-15-6-PC-Laptop-Intel-i3-N305-8GB-256GB-Win-11-Home-S-mode-Mixed-Black-E1504GA-WS36%2F5727766555&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) is no exception. For just $249 right now at Walmart, this is a thin, ultra-portable laptop that weighs 3.5 pounds and is 0.7 inches thick; a solid option for remote workers or anyone looking to snag a sleek and inexpensive travel laptop.

Asus' Vivobook line features some of the most bold and high-performing laptops on the market right now, especially the [Vivobook S 15](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-productivity-laptops-ive-tested-is-not-a-lenovo-thinkpad-or-macbook/), a model I went hands-on with earlier this year and praised for its brilliant display and great battery life. Additionally, we reviewed the [Vivobook Pro 15](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-asus-laptop-looks-unassuming-but-it-has-a-powerful-feature-creatives-will-love/), a powerhouse laptop for creators and professionals at a competitive price point. 

The Vivobook Go line keeps the well-rounded lineup of features from these two higher-end machines and scales it down to more accessible hardware for a price point that won't break the bank. In fact, for just [$249 at Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FASUS-Vivobook-Go-15-6-PC-Laptop-Intel-i3-N305-8GB-256GB-Win-11-Home-S-mode-Mixed-Black-E1504GA-WS36%2F5727766555&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) ahead of the [Walmart Holiday Deals event](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fshop%2Fdeals&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp), you get a thin and portable laptop that looks like it costs much more.

**Also: [One of the most versatile laptops I've tested also has one of the best displays](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-most-versatile-laptops-ive-tested-also-has-one-of-the-best-displays/)**

The Vivobook Go 15.6 has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which is a reasonable hardware configuration for the money. With it, you can expect to be able to tackle typical workflows, from web browsing to answering emails to work-related productivity tasks. 

Asus bundles the laptop with a 720p HD webcam with AI-powered noise cancellation to automatically filter out background noise, making video conferencing from the neighborhood coffee shop a breeze. Once you're done with calls for the day, the physical webcam shield can be closed for additional privacy.

The Vivobook Go also comes with a broad selection of ports for maximum connectivity. You've got two USB-As, a USB-C, HDMI port, a 3.5mm audio jack, and a DC In port. Additionally, you can lay this laptop completely flat if you want to hook it up to an external monitor and just use the keyboard. Both the ports and display flexibility are not aspects you'd find in every premium laptop nowadays.

**Also: [This Asus laptop is my go-to MacBook alternative (and it does several things better)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-asus-laptop-is-my-go-to-macbook-alternative-and-it-does-several-things-better/)**

Under the hood, the Vivobook Go has an Intel Core i3-N305 processor running at 1.8 GHz to handle typical workflows and everyday multitasking. This isn't the most performant processor on the market, but it also won't require a ton of battery power, so the efficiency and endurance of the device should be above average.

Finally, one of the best parts of the Vivobook line are these laptops' bold design that emphasizes the display. This laptop has an 84% screen-to-body ratio, meaning the FHD 1920 x 1080 resolution display's ultra-thin bezels take up most of the actual physical body, even with the full-sized keyboard and ergonomically-placed trackpad. 

All in all, if you're looking for a sleek, lightweight travel laptop or a backup machine while working remotely, the [Vivobook Go 15.6](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FASUS-Vivobook-Go-15-6-PC-Laptop-Intel-i3-N305-8GB-256GB-Win-11-Home-S-mode-Mixed-Black-E1504GA-WS36%2F5727766555&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp) has a nice-sized screen that's not too big or too small for only $249 ($80 off at the time of writing). The full-sized keyboard offers a comfortable work setup, and the generous port selections make this computer well-rounded enough for a variety of everyday use cases.
