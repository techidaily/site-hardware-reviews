Target has an expansive catalog of items on sale, but we only picked items that have at least a 20% discount since we know there's lots of gift-giving going on. We included all kinds of devices, from smartwatches to TVs and wireless headphones. So, if you're looking for a discount, we've got you covered. 

If you're doing all or most of your holiday shopping at Target, it's important to know that the prices included in this list are how much you'll pay if you buy the item online, and prices will vary if you decide to buy an item in-store.
