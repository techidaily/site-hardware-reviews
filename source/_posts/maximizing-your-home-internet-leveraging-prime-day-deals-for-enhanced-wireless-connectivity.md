## Maximizing Your Home Internet: Leveraging Prime Day Deals for Enhanced Wireless Connectivity

It's been three years since I set up an eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi network in my home. And, for the most part, the eero system's been perfect. But I've been spending more time in my basement where the Wi-Fi signal isn't very strong, so I'm using Prime Day as an opportunity to fix the situation.

 Mesh Wi-Fi systems are [pretty straightforward](https://easy-unlock-android.techidaily.com/in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-motorola-edge-2023-pattern-lock-screen-everything-you-need-to-know-by-drfone-android/). Plug a mesh Wi-Fi router into your modem, place a few nodes across your home, and your Wi-Fi signal magically has a lot more range (without the awfulness of an old-fashioned range extender). You can also use the nodes for wired Ethernet connections, which is a lot more convenient than running one of those 50-foot Ethernet cables across your home.

 My house has thick walls and is shaped like a comically narrow rectangle. And, unfortunately, my modem is stuck at one of the far sides of the home—I _need_ a mesh system for whole-home coverage. The eero 6 system has done its job; one router and two nodes deliver speeds of 400 Mbps or more to every room.

 The main reason that I bought into the eero system is the ease of upgradability. If I want a stronger mesh network, I can just add another node. And, importantly, any eero router can serve as a new node. I don't need to buy another expensive eero 6 router, I can just buy one of the cheaper models and toss it into my basement.

 Obviously, I'm taking advantage of Prime Day pricing, which brings the [basic eero router](https://amazon.com/dp/B07WGJ8ZD3?tag=htgprimedaysite-20h-router/dp/B07WGJ8ZD3?) down to just $40 (almost half price). I don't mind that this node is slower than my eero 6 routers, as the main problem in my basement is reliability, rather than speed.

 And, for reference, I tested if this idea would work by bringing one of my existing eero 6 nodes down to the basement. It worked perfectly, so I'm confident that the cheap new node will solve my problem.

 Nearly all eero routers and bundles [are on sale](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/1543F8A6-D787-4CB6-8317-BFD2C618A3B6?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) for Prime Day. The [eero 6 bundle](https://amazon.com/dp/B085WSCTS4?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) that I bought three years ago is currently just $150, which is an outstanding price, and the [standard eero bundle](https://amazon.com/dp/B0C41FK17W?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) is just $100.

 I'm also surprised to see that [refurbished eero routers](https://eero.com/deals) are on sale. But I can't really speak on the quality of these refurbished items, as I've only bought new.

They're low profile, unobtrusive, and anything but a bulky black box bristling with antennas.
