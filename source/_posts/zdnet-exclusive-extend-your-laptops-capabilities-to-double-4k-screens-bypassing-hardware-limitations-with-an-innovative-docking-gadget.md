**Also:** [**The best college tech you can buy, according to recent grads**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/10-tech-gadgets-you-actually-need-for-college-according-to-recent-grads/)

Thanks to Samsung's offers, students can save up to $350 on Samsung's newest [Galaxy Book 4 Edge](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-samsungs-new-copilot-pc-and-it-stands-out-from-the-crowd-in-3-major-ways/) laptop right now. ZDNET's Kyle Kucharski tested the [Galaxy Book 4 Edge](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fgalaxy-book4-edge%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) back in July, and he called it "a flagship laptop with a gorgeous display, impressive performance, and deep integration with Samsung's ecosystem of devices."

Kucharski says the Book 4 Edge is a Copilot+ PC with the new Snapdragon X Elite processor that's nothing short of a statement-making machine. 

**Also:** [**I tested Samsung's new Copilot+ PC, and it stands out from the crowd in 3 major ways**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-samsungs-new-copilot-pc-and-it-stands-out-from-the-crowd-in-3-major-ways/)

"The laptop feels as good as it looks and nails the features consumers care about the most: a brilliant display, a thin and light form factor, and a marathon battery," he says. "I recently had a chance to go hands-on with the Edge, using it as my primary driver for a week as I commuted to and from the office and worked remotely, and I really enjoyed it. This thing is a banger; It's light, it has lightning-fast performance, a fantastic battery, a gorgeous display, and surprisingly good speakers."

You can also nab other top tech from Samsung, including the [Galaxy Tab A9+ 128GB](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftablets%2Fgalaxy-tab-a9-plus%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-tab-a9-plus-128gb-graphite-wi-fi-sm-x210nzaexar%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) for up to $40 off and the new [Galaxy Tab A9+ Kids edition](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftablets%2Fgalaxy-tab-a9-plus%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-tab-a9-plus-kids-edition-64gb-blue-wi-fi-sm-x210nzavxar%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1).
