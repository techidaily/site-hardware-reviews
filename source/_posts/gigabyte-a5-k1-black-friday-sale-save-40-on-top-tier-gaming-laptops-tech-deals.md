This is one of the lowest prices we've seen on this model, and the device some with abundant features. Under the backlit keyboard, the AMD Ryzen 5600H mobile processor is capable of running heavy games, so you can play top hits like Stray or Elden Ring. Plus, with 16GB RAM, you'll get speedy responses in-game.

Plus, you get great storage for the price, as this laptop offers 512GB PCle Gen3 SSD for your storage needs -- that's hard to beat.

My personal favorite spec on this laptop is the graphics card. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU can handle most games. Sure, you could opt for a laptop that offers a 3070 or even a 3080, but that will skyrocket the price. The 3060 offers excellent graphics for the price point on this laptop.

You'll get a 15.6-inch anti-glare screen with a refresh rate of up to 144Hz. The laptop also comes with Black Friday Price Protection, so if the price drops again -- something we don't foresee -- Newegg will automatically refund you the price difference via your original payment method.
