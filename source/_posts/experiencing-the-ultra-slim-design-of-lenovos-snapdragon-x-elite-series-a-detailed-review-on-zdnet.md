Intel recently announced its 13th Gen Intel Core i9 desktop processors, but hasn't announced their mobile counterparts. The 2022 ThinkPad X1 also came with Core i5 and Core i7 mobile processors. [ZDNet recently reviewed the ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 10](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-10-review/), which featured the 12th generation Intel [Core i7-1255U](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/226259/intel-core-i71255u-processor-12m-cache-up-to-4-70-ghz/specifications.html) processor.

Lenovo points to updates to features like Lenovo View as a result of the shift to hybrid work. "Collaboration features like auto-framing, background concealment, and virtual presenter upgrade those on-camera calls to make the presenter front and center," it said.

Each of the laptops comes with a decent array of ports, including two Thunderbolt 4/USB-C ports, two USB-A 3.2 ports, one HDMI 2.0b port, and a 3.5mm audio jack. They're all thin, at no more than 0.61 inches and reasonably lightweight; the heaviest, the Yoga, weighs 3 pounds. 

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 11 is expected to start at $1,729, while The ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 8 is expected to start at $1,859, and the ThinkPad X1 Nano Gen 3 should start from $1,649\. All of them will be available from April 2023\.
