My laptop bag is a mess of tangled cables. I try to coil them neatly, but with everything from [Raspberry Pi](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-the-most-affordable-raspberry-pi-5-ever-whats-new-and-why-its-so-cheap/) computers to toolkits being tossed in and pulled out, chaos inevitably takes over. 

The main culprit of my messy laptop bag is cables. I usually have a few USB-C cables and a MagSafe charging cable for my MacBook Pro, and too often, these have tangled into a big, messy ball that takes several minutes to untangle.

And before you ask, yes, I do know how to [roll cables](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Mm9YYp6a1M) up properly!

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Magtame 3.3 foot, 240W USB-C-to-USB-C cable No more messy cables thanks to the power of magnets! View at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMagtame-Charger-Magnetic-Charging-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0CKZHTGZF%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C15f7dcb7-0ad1-4647-be19-a9786326ab49%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

I stumbled upon "magnetic" cables recently that claim to use magnets to coil themselves automatically. It sounded too good to be true, but I decided to take a chance and bought a Magtame USB-C cable. And I'm glad I did.

Now that's magic!

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

Magtame offers a variety of cables, including 240W fast-charge USB-C-to-USB-C cables, more affordable 60W USB-C-to-USB-C options, USB-A-to-Lightning cables, and 2-in-1 USB cables with built-in adapters.

For testing, I chose a 3.3-foot, 240W USB-C-to-USB-C cable, and it's an impressive piece of hardware. The cable is thick yet flexible, with tough yet smooth nylon braiding. The connectors are high-quality, sturdy, and securely attached to the cable's body."

High quality nylon braid is tough, wear-resistant, yet soft.

The cable also features an E-Marker chip, which devices use to identify its maximum speed and current capacity, so it's up to the task of carrying high loads. On the data front, the cable has a rated data transfer rate of 480Mbps, which is decent.

But what separates this cable from the rest are the magnets built into the cable at regular intervals. These magnets seek out each other and automatically -- I want to say magically -- curl the cable up. You can easily make small coils.

Small coils!

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

Or even larger loops for easier holding. The magnets are strong enough to hold the loops in place while being loose enough for you to unwind them easily.

Bigger loops!

Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET

Naturally, I had a question related to heat: Would a curled–up cable carrying 100W+ of power get hot? I tested this a number of times under different loads, and while the cable would get warmer than the surroundings, it never became hot.

A coiled Magtame cable doesn't get hot even under heavy load.

## ZDNET's buying advice

It seems like a simple thing, but these curly, magnetically coiled cables are a game changer for anyone who has a lot of cables. My laptop bag is a lot more organized now that I have swapped out a handful of my old, most-used cables for [Magtame cables](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMagtame-Charger-Magnetic-Charging-Compatible%2Fdp%2FB0CKZHTGZF%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C15f7dcb7-0ad1-4647-be19-a9786326ab49%7Cdtp&dtb=1). 

I bought these with very low expectations -- after all, it's just a coiling cable! But now, I can't imagine not having them.
