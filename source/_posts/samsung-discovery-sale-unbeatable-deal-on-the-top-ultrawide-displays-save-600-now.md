## Samsung Discovery Sale: Unbeatable Deal on the Top Ultrawide Displays - Save $600 Now!

Our favorite ultrawide monitor is part of Samsung's Discover Sale, and you can save $600 on it until June 2nd.

 You know what can take your gaming experience to the next level? An incredible [ultrawide monitor](https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-handheld-panorama-peacekeeper-360-stabilizer-for-2024/). I mean, who wouldn't want more screen real estate for their games? Of course, ultrawide monitors are more expensive than their [normal-sized compatriots](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/ensuring-device-compatibility-a-how-to-for-backing-up-drivers-in-windows-1110/), but if you're patient, you can wait for a sale to take a chunk off the price tag.

 If you've been eyeing the [Samsung Odyssey OLED G9](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fmonitors%2Fgaming%2F49-odyssey-oled-g95sc-dqhd-neo-quantum-processor-pro-0-03ms-240hz-curved-smart-gaming-monitor-ls49cg954snxza%2F), our pick for the [best ultrawide monitor](https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-handheld-panorama-peacekeeper-360-stabilizer-for-2024/) and the [best curved ultrawide monitor](https://instagram-videos.techidaily.com/in-2024-crafting-moments-instagrams-highlight-and-download-insights/), today is that day. As part of the [Discover Samsung Sale](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fall-deals%2F), you can pick up this huge monitor for $1,199.99, $600 off the full price.

 So, what do you get for that price? You get a fantastic OLED screen, a 240Hz refresh rate (most of our ultrawide recommendations only manage 140Hz or 165Hz), compatibility with NVIDIA's G-Sync and AMD's FreeSync for [variable refresh rates](https://iphone-location.techidaily.com/how-to-change-your-location-on-apple-iphone-13-pro-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-ios/), and plenty more.

 All that said, $1,199.99 is still a large chunk of change to drop all at once. Samsung realizes this and offers payment plans to make the price easier to handle. You can either sign up to pay $50 a month for 24 months, or $300 in four two-week installments, with no additional interest charges added. These quotes don't include the sales tax for your state, so the final payments might be slightly higher to account for that, but you shouldn't expect to pay anything over the final price.
