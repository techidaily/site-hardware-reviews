Alienware's design framework, dubbed Legend, is now stepping into its third update of function and design elements that aim to enhance "interactivity and convenience -- all while enabling higher performing technology."

The new laptops represent a shift from Alienware, which typically focuses on 15-inch and 17-inch screen sizes. Alienware says it's now able to deliver devices with 16-inch and 18-inch screen sizes thanks to improvements in thermal technologies.

Alienware's m18 is the "most powerful laptop," thanks to 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13980HX processors, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPUs, AMD Ryzen Processors, and Radeon Graphics. 

New thermal improvements increase the laptop's airflow by 25% and thermal capacity by 35%, allowing for improved cooling to elevate the laptop's power to 250W.

According to Dell, the m16 provides similar performance and enhanced technologies in a more compact build.
