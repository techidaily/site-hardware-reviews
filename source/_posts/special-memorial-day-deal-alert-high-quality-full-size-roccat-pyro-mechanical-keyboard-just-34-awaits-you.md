Sporting the same color scheme as that of a retro Nintendo games console from the 80s, it includes two oversized buttons reminiscent of the ones on the NES controller.

 The layout of the keyboard is similar to a TKL with the number pad removed. There are 87 keys, with perfectly matched Nintendo-colored dye-sub PBT keycaps giving that awesome aesthetic. The switches used are Kailh box white V2s, although the PCB is hot-swappable. You can always swap to a preferred switch if the included Kailh box white switches aren't to your liking.
