The vacuum itself features a 230ml water tank and is able to clean up to 1,290 square feet of space. The vacuum function has two levels of suction so you can adjust noise levels as well as adjust suction for hardwood, carpet, and tile.

ZDNET has not tested this robot vacuum (here's [our list of tested top picks](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-robot-vacuum/)) and we think it's fair to point out that it has 40 one-star reviews on Walmart.
