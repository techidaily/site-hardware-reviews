HP

Black Friday and Cyber Monday have ended, but this week some US retailers are still promoting deals and discounts on a broad range of tech, gadgets, and gifts. One vendor taking this approach is HP. The PC giant has launched [HP Cyber Week](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&awinaffid=423585&clickref=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fslp%2Fcyber-sale%2Ftop-deals), a week-long sales event in the aftermath of Black Friday that includes substantial discounts on PCs, laptops, monitors, and more. 

Our favorites include [a bundle](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&awinaffid=423585&clickref=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-m24fw%25C2%25A0monitor-wireless-mouse-keyboard-kit-m24fw-mon-kb-ms-kit) with a 24-inch HP monitor, wireless mouse, and wireless keyboard. While normally set at a retail price of $240, HP has cut the price by $105, or 43%. This bundle can be a great way to set up your new home office or make sure your student is prepared when they return to their dorm after the holidays.

There are also two other deals that particularly stand out from the 55 products on sale. 

The first is a cheap Chromebook. The [HP Chromebook 11a](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&awinaffid=423585&clickref=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-chromebook-11a-na0060nr) is a budget-friendly ChromeOS device suitable for study or general daily use. It comes with an 11.6-inch touchscreen display, a MediaTek processor, 4GB RAM, and 32GB eMMC storage. The price has been slashed to $170 from $300, savings of $130, or 43%. 

The second deal is for a [HP Omen 25i gaming monitor](https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&awinaffid=423585&clickref=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fomen-25i-gaming-fhd-monitor). This 24.5-inch monitor offers a Full HD (1920 x 1080) display, a 165Hz refresh rate, and HP Eye Ease technology for comfortable viewing. Normally, you would expect to pay $300, but this week HP has cut the price to $210, with savings of $90 (30%).
