 Google is getting ready to announce the next generation of Pixel smartphones. The [already-announced Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro](https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/in-2024-best-pokemons-for-pvp-matches-in-pokemon-go-for-oppo-reno-10-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/) should be shown off at the event, which takes place on October 19, 2021, at 1 pm ET (10 am PT). The company may also have some surprises to show off, as well.

##  How to Watch The Pixel 6 Event

 If you want to learn about the future of Google's smartphones, you can head over to [Google's event page](https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/).

 Of, if you want an even easier way to watch, bookmark this page and watch the YouTube video we've embedded above.

##  What to Expect From the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro

 One of the most exciting aspects of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro is Google's new [Tensor processor](https://howto.techidaily.com/8-ultimate-fixes-for-google-play-your-xiaomi-redmi-k70-pro-isnt-compatible-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/), which is a significant departure from the Qualcomm processors Google typically uses. The company says that Tensor "enables us to make the Google phones we've always envisioned."

 While we know Google is going to use its own chip in the Pixel 6, the company didn't reveal much about the actual specs of the chip, so we'll have to wait until the big event on September 19, 2021, to learn more about what it brings to the table for processing power.

 We've already learned a bit about the screens on the devices. According to [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4), the Pro has a 6.7-inch QHD+ display with a 120Hz refresh rate. The Pixel 6 will come with a 6.4-inch FHD+ screen with a 90Hz refresh rate.

 We also discovered that the phone would have three cameras, but we didn't learn the actual specs of the lenses. With Google focusing on the [quality of the cameras](https://win11.techidaily.com/speedy-surge-troubleshoot-for-a-swift-windows-11/) for its Pixel devices, we expect the company to put a heavy focus on them at the event as well.

 It's a bit different to go into an event like this already knowing the two primary devices that'll be on display, but it'll be interesting to see what details Google still wants to show off.

##  What Else Will Google Announce?

 Outside of the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, there's a lot of speculation that Google will announce a [foldable Pixel device](https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-is-it-possible-to-watch-fb-videos-on-tv/). Unfortunately, Google has been extremely quiet regarding a folding phone, so we'll have to wait and see if the company has something to announce in that regard.

 Besides devices, the company will likely let us know when [Android 12](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/new-top-5-budget-friendly-pinterest-video-grabs/) will launch on Pixel devices. While Android 12 is technically out, it hasn't made its way to phones, so we'd expect the company to fill us in regarding when we can download the OS.
