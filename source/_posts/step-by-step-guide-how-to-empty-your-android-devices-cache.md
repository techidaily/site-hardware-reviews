Cache files are temporary and can be deleted without disrupting your apps. Here's how to clear your app and browser cache on Android.

##  How to Clear the App Cache on Android

 You can clear the app cache on your Android phone to fix their issues as well as make room for new apps on your device.

 In this guide, we've used a Samsung Galaxy phone for demonstration. The steps will vary slightly depending on your phone model, but you'll have a general idea as to what option to choose.

 To start, launch the Settings app on your Android phone. Then, select "Apps."

![Select 'Apps' in Settings.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/1-android-apps.png) 

 On the "Apps" page, next to "Your Apps," choose the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines).

![Tap the three horizontal lines next to "Your Apps."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2-android-app-menu.png) 

 You'll now sort your apps by their size so the largest app appears at the top of the list. Note that this doesn't necessarily put your largest cache-occupying app at the top, but still, this helps.

 In the menu that opens, in the "Sort By" section, choose "Size." Then, at the bottom, tap "OK."

![Select "Size" and tap "OK."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/3-android-sort-apps-by-size.png) 

 From the app list on your screen, select the app for which you want to clear the cache.

![Choose an app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/4-android-choose-app.png) 

 On the app's page, scroll down a bit and select "Storage."

![Tap "Storage."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/5-android-app-storage.png) 

 On the "Storage" screen, next to "Cache," you'll see the current cache size for your selected app. To clear the cache, in the bottom-right corner of your screen, tap "Clear Cache."

![Select "Clear Cache" in the bottom-right corner.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/6-android-clear-app-cache.png) 

 Your phone will clear the selected app's cache without any prompts.

 As you start using your apps, they'll re-create the cache files to provide you with a better app experience. You don't have to clear the cache every day, but it's a good idea to do it every once in a while, especially [when you're experiencing app-related issues.](https://youtube-help.techidaily.com/in-2024-streamline-your-thumbnail-design-journey-today/)

##  How to Clear the Browser Cache on Android

 Like other apps, your web browsers like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Microsoft Edge store cached images and site files. These files help improve your browsing experience.

 However, if you [experience problems with your browser](https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-discovering-the-finest-mac-screen-capture-software/), it's a good idea to clear your cache. Doing so only removes the cached images and other files; your site logins and other items remain intact.

###  Delete Chrome's Cache

 Start by launching Chrome on your Android phone. Then, in the browser's top-right corner, tap the three dots and choose "Settings."

![Tap "Settings" in the menu.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/7-chrome-android-settings.png)

 In "Settings," select "Privacy and Security."

![Choose "Privacy and Security."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/8-chrome-android-privacy-security.png) 

 On the "Privacy and Security" page, choose "Clear Browsing Data."

![Choose "Delete Browsing Data" in "Settings."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/12-firefox-android-delete-browsing-data.png) 

 On the "Delete Browsing Data" page, enable the "Cached Images and Files" option. Then, tap "Delete Browsing Data." Feel free to enable other options if you'd like to remove those items from your browser.

![Enable "Cached Images and Files" and tap](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/13-firefox-android-clear-cache.png)
