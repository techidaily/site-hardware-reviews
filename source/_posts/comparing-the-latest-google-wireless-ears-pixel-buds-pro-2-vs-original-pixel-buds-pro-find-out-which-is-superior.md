Google's latest version of its premium earbuds are here, and the Google Pixel Buds 2 have a list of meaningful upgrades to go along with the new line of Pixel smartphones. From upgraded connectivity to increased water resistance, the [Pixel Buds Pro 2](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Fbuds%5Fpro%5F2?hl=en-US) offer plenty of premium features for Google smartphone users.

Still, the first-generation Pixel Buds Pro may be best for your audio needs, especially if you can do without upgraded software features. There are some major differences between 2022's Pixel Buds Pro and 2024's Pixel Buds Pro 2, so let's go over them.

##  You should buy the Pixel Buds Pro 2 if...  

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

###  1\. You frequently lose your earbuds

The new Pixel Buds Pro 2 debut with a small but significant new hardware feature. Like the AirPods Pro 2, the new Pixel Buds have a small speaker on the charging case. If you lose your earbuds but know they are nearby, you can access the Find My Device app to make the earbuds case speaker chime.

**Also: [Google unveils Pixel Buds Pro 2: Here are the three features I'm most excited about](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-unveils-pixel-buds-pro-2-here-are-the-three-features-im-most-excited-about/)**

This feature is incredibly helpful if you are like me and frequently misplace your earbuds around your house. Although Google promises that an upgraded Find My Device network can make finding your devices easier, sometimes it's easier to find your earbuds by sound instead of sight.

###  2\. You want upgraded connectivity

The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are equipped with the latest version of Bluetooth, version 5.4\. This upgraded Bluetooth version ensures a more stable connection between your earbuds and your listening device, like a [Pixel phone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-google-phone/) or a [Chromebook](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-chromebook-laptop/). Additionally, this Bluetooth version allows each earbud to connect individually with your listening device, making the wireless connection stronger and more reliable.

The new Pixel Buds are also compatible with LE Audio, which promotes lower audio latency -- especially valuable during mobile gaming sessions. LE Audio also brings more efficient power consumption and enhanced audio quality.

##  You should buy the Pixel Buds Pro if... 

June Wan/ZDNET

###  1\. You want the more affordable option

The first-generation Pixel Buds Pro were released in July 2022, making them over two years old. It's unclear how long Google will continue updating the first-generation Pixel Buds Pro, but they can currently connect to Android devices running Android 4.0 and later. Thus, these earbuds are compatible with a wide range of Android devices for a lower price.

**Also: [Google Pixel Buds Pro review: AirPods Pro, but for Android](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-buds-pro-review/)**

Of course, now that newer Pixel Buds are on the market, you can expect retailers to offer the first-generation Buds at a lower price. Google may discontinue sales on its website, and you may have to look for them at other places, like Best Buy or Amazon.

###  2\. You want more color options

The new Pixel Buds Pro 2 are available in four color (Porcelain, Hazel, Wintergreen, and Peony), but Google notes that all colors may not be available in some regions. On the other hand, the first-generation Buds are available in six colors, all available in the US.

The first-generation Pixel Buds are the better option if you prefer more color options to match your earbuds to your personal style and aesthetic.
