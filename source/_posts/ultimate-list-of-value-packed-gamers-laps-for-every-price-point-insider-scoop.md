## How did I choose these gaming laptops?

Before you buy a gaming laptop, take a moment to reflect on these considerations.

* **Processor:** Also known as the CPU, the processor is like the brain of the computer, helping everything to run properly and quickly. Most gaming laptops incorporate processors like the Intel Core i9 or i7, or you may see an AMD Ryzen 7 or 9 processor in other laptops. When shopping, remember this rule of thumb: the higher the number, the more powerful the processor.
* **Graphics card:** When gaming, it is critical to have the best graphics card possible so your game can feel lifelike with rich colors and vivid images. Most of the best gaming laptops tend to incorporate NVIDIA GeForce or AMD Radeon graphics cards.
* **Connectivity:** Laptops generally do not offer as many ports as their desktop companions, but that does not mean you are out of luck. The best gaming laptops will offer plenty of options, such as USB-C, USB-A, Thunderbolt 4, and HDMI ports.
* **Price:** The cost of a good gaming laptop can vary significantly, with the difference ranging several thousands of dollars. Things like your processor, graphics card, and memory can all impact the price, so keep these things in mind when shopping. To help give you an idea of what to expect, we found that the best gaming laptops range from $650 to more than $3,800 in price.

## Which brand is best for gaming laptops?

When shopping for gaming laptops, you will find that there are many options available by several different computer manufacturers. Some manufacturers may specialize in [budget gaming laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-budget-gaming-laptop/), while others may focus on high-end laptops. In our search, we found the best gaming laptops came from leading manufacturers such as Razer, Acer, Asus, and HP.

## Can you buy a gaming laptop for $1,000?

It is easy to spend several thousand dollars on a gaming laptop, but it is possible to find a great gaming[laptop under $1,000](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop-under-1000/) when you are on a budget. With the Acer Nitro 5 and HP Victus 15 priced around $650, you can easily purchase a quality laptop under $1,000 without sacrificing key features. 

## How much RAM do I need in a gaming laptop?

RAM refers to random-access memory, or the amount of memory that your computer has. It is critical that your gaming laptop has enough RAM to run your favorite games and save files. Typically, the best gaming laptops have at least eight megabytes of RAM but the general rule of thumb is the more RAM, the better.
