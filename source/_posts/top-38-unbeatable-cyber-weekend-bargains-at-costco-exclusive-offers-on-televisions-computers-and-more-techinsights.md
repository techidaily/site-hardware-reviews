## **Best Costco Cyber Monday deals still available**

Below are the best Costco deals we found could find that are still available. However, if we could find the same deal at other popular retailers or at least the same product heavily discounted elsewhere, we included those shopping options as well. 

[Apple MacBook Pro M2 512GB for $1,350 Save $100](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://www.costco.com/.product.100806176.html) 

Costco

Costco has discounted the 13-inch MacBook Pro down to $1,350, becoming one of the only retailers to offer it at such a low price.

An improved, higher-performing M2 means faster video workflows for editors, for example, with an 8-core CPU with four performance cores and 4 efficiency cores, and a 10-core GPU. Available options for memory range from 8GB, 16GB, to 24GB, and storage from 256GB, 512GB, 1TB, and 2TB SSDs.

## What's the best Costco membership type?

Costco, like some other retailers, offers a membership-based shopping experience both in its warehouses and online. Each membership is paid annually and includes a household card that you present at the store.

Here's how the different memberships stack up:

| **Gold** **Star**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Business**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | **Executive**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
