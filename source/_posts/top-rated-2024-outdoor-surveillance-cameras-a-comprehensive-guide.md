##  What to Look For in an Outdoor Security Camera in 2024

 There is an excellent selection of outdoor security cameras on the market, but not every security camera will suit your needs or be a great fit for your security setup. It's crucial to [remember a few things](https://hardware-help.techidaily.com/latest-toshiba-driver-updates-for-windows-pcs-free-downloads-available/) before starting your security camera shopping.

 One of the first things [you'll want to look for in an outdoor security camera](https://www.reviewgeek.com/56458/how-to-pick-a-security-camera/) is its video quality. Higher-resolution cameras typically have better video quality with much more detail. But you must balance your budget, [network bandwidth](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/in-2024-is-pgsharp-legal-when-you-are-playing-pokemon-on-poco-m6-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), and available storage. 1080p or 2K cameras are sufficient for most people.

 The video storage options and subscription-based features will also play a vital role in your purchase. Unless you are okay with paying monthly subscription fees for cloud storage, you'll want an outdoor security camera with local storage. Similarly, some cameras lock many features behind a subscription plan. So you'll have to be mindful of what you are getting for free and what you may have to pay extra for.

 Features like night vision support, two-way audio, and motion alerts are essential. Most decent cameras will have these, but you check expert and user reviews for how different security cameras perform in these aspects. Also, if you plan to install a complete security system with sensors, motion detectors, and other smart devices. In that case, it's a good idea to pick an outdoor security camera that plays well with the rest of the security system.

 Lastly, privacy is a [tricky topic with security cameras](https://extra-approaches.techidaily.com/new-meta-versus-omni-the-future-of-digital-worlds/). If the video from your cameras goes to the company servers for storage or processing, there is always a risk of a [breach](https://www.reviewgeek.com/159338/what-to-do-when-involved-in-a-data-breach/) or leak. The [track record of most security camera manufacturers](https://games-able.techidaily.com/aim-for-glory-the-ultimate-ranking-of-online-fps-browser-games/) is not excellent. For example, [several security flaws were found](https://www.reviewgeek.com/139777/instead-of-fixing-its-privacy-debacle-eufy-changed-the-terms-of-the-deal/) in Anker's Eufy security cameras in 2022, [Nest cameras were hacked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/04/23/how-nest-designed-keep-intruders-out-peoples-homes-effectively-allowed-hackers-get/) in 2019, and [a Wyze Cam vulnerability](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/wyze-cam-flaw-lets-hackers-remotely-access-your-saved-videos/) allowed remote access to locally stored images and videos. So you have to decide whether you are okay with the off chance of footage from your outdoor security camera leaking or being accidentally shared with someone else. Remember, no internet-connected device is 100% safe.

| Pros                                                        | Cons                  |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Free access to activity alerts and three-hour event history | A bit pricey          |
| Easy to install and set up                                  | No color night vision |
| Option to go wireless or wired                              |                       |

 The [Google Next Cam](https://www.amazon.com/Nest-Cam-Outdoor-Indoor-Battery/dp/B09FCMSJZG/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904723&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-outdoor-security-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), officially known as the Google Nest Cam (battery), is a fantastic outdoor security camera with wire-free installation, excellent video quality, and built-in smart detection. It's a bit expensive, but its inclusion of local backup storage makes it a better value than competing security cameras.

 Unlike the previous generation of Nest cameras, the Nest Cam's built-in battery allows you to install it anywhere within [range of your Wi-Fi signal](https://sim-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-network-locked-sim-card-inserted-on-your-xiaomi-mix-fold-3-phone-unlock-it-now-by-drfone-android/) and not worry about running a cable for power. But if you want to avoid charging it every few months, you can buy a [$35 weatherproof power cable](https://www.amazon.com/Google-Nest-Weatherproof-Cable-Battery/dp/B09HNS9XPP/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904723&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-outdoor-security-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for a wired installation.

 The Nest Cam has a clean design and features you expect from security cameras, including 1080p video recording, two-way talk, and a 130-degree field of view. The audio and video quality are excellent, and the installation is hassle-free.

 Although several Nest features are locked behind a subscription, you can get free alerts for activity zones and three-hour event history. However, a [Nest Aware subscription](https://store.google.com/us/product/nest%5Faware) will get you familiar face detection, sound alerts, at least 30 days of event history, and the ability to call 911 from the Google Home app.

 The Nest Cam's one big drawback is its lack of color night vision. Unlike our other recommendations, it captures [IR-powered black-and-white videos](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/new-fast-and-easy-10-high-resolution-passport-portraits-for-desktopweb-use/) in low light. That said, the quality of this black-and-white recording is pretty decent. But if your heart is set on color night vision, you can opt for the Arlo Pro 4, our pick for the best wireless outdoor security camera.

| Pros                                            | Cons                                            |

| Cloud subscription or local storage up to 256GB |                                                 |

 Going "budget" with home or personal security can require careful weighing of pros and cons. While many low-cost outdoor cameras are available, it's important to make sure you go with something you can trust, and that usually means sticking with brands already proven to be reputable.

 The [Kasa Smart 2K QHD Security Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Kasa-Starlight-Detection-Compatible-KC420WS/dp/B09SBRB59Z?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904723&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-outdoor-security-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), made by TP-Link, has that part of the equation and doesn't scrimp on usability despite costing around $40\. Featuring motion detection, two-way audio, Smart Actions, an intruder deterrent siren, and the ability to send images and notifications to your phone using the built-in Wi-Fi, it has everything the security-conscious person could want.

 While it won't provide the video quality you would expect from a $150 camera, 2K QHD is ample to produce clear and crisp images. Dual IR spotlights allow for 98ft of vision even during the dead of night, and the IP65 waterproof rating means you don't have to worry about malfunction when the weather turns bad.

 You'll need a subscription to [Kasa Care](https://www.kasasmart.com/us/kasacare) for cloud storage of videos, or you can pick up a [256GB MicroSD card](https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-Extreme-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B09X7CRKRZ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904723&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-outdoor-security-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) for cheap and store everything locally. A 10ft USB cable powers the Kasa Smart 2K camera outlet, but if that doesn't work, the battery-powered [Tapo 2K Outdoor Camera](https://www.amazon.com/security-camera-wireless-outdoor-tapo/dp/B08LHG2W7Y?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904723&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-outdoor-security-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) offers almost identical features for a similar price.

| Pros                                        | Cons                  |

| Completely wireless                         |                       |
| Color night vision                          |                       |

 Although the [Arlo Pro 4](https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Pro-Spotlight-Camera-Wire-Free/dp/B08L746NXW/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904723&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-outdoor-security-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is almost three years old, it remains a top choice among wireless security cameras thanks to its versatility and impressive performance. The Pro 4 can capture in 2K resolution, and the resulting video is crisp with plenty of detail. The camera also has a wide 160-degree field of view, and you get color night vision with a built-in spotlight for low-light situations.

 Being a wireless camera, the Arlo camera packs a battery, which the company claims can last up to six months on a single charge. But if you choose the "Best Video" setting, you'll have to juice it up after around six weeks. Thankfully, you can pull the battery out without the need to uninstall the camera when it's time to juice it up, which takes under three hours.

 You also get the usual features, such as two-way talk, siren, and support for digital assistants such as [Alexa](https://fox-links.techidaily.com/updated-illusions-realized-what-is-augmented-reality-for-2024/) and [Google Assistant](https://review-topics.techidaily.com/issues-playing-h-265-hevc-video-on-redmi-a2-by-aiseesoft-video-converter-play-hevc-video-on-android/). It can also work with [Apple HomeKit](https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unveiling-the-secrets-of-m1-max-clips/), but you'll need the company's [SmartHub](https://www.amazon.com/Arlo-Accessory-Smart-Compatible-Cameras/dp/B07YD5S9FX/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904723&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-outdoor-security-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce), which costs $100.

 Unfortunately, the Arlo Pro 4 is not the cheapest option, and you'll need an [Arlo Secure](https://www.arlo.com/en-us/arlosecure.html) subscription to access most of its features. Subscriptions start at $5 and go up to $25 a month. But besides the cost, it's a great outdoor security camera that won't disappoint.

 The [Ring Alarm Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Alarm-Pro-8-piece-kit/dp/B08HSTJPM5/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904723&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-outdoor-security-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) is undoubtedly the [best home security system](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/increase-your-videos-impact-essential-keyword-analysis-resources/) for most people. It can work with various sensors, motion detectors, video doorbells, and more, including outdoor security cameras. It delivers a responsive and reliable experience, and the Ring app on [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU904723/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ringapp&hl=en%5FUS) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ring-always-home/id926252661) offers detailed instructions to install the system efficiently.

 One of the unique features of the Ring security system is the built-in [Eero Wi-Fi 6 router](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VM9ZDD/ref=twister%5FB08GB83F7C?%5Fencoding=UTF8&psc=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU904723&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fbest-outdoor-security-cameras%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Commerce) that's ready for the [Internet of Things](https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-optimizing-display-youtubes-zoom-mastery/) and has no trouble reaching and communicating with the various sensors and gadgets you put around the house as a part of the security system. Moreover, Ring Alarm Pro can offer backup data connectivity through a mobile data connection to your Wi-Fi-enabled devices in case your internet connection faces an outage. You will get 3GB of free mobile data per month, which isn't a lot but enough for occasional interruptions.

 All of Ring Alarm Pro's features aren't cheap, howeverâyou'll need to pay $20 monthly for everything the system offers as part of the [Protect Pro Plan](https://ring.com/professional-monitoring). You can go for cheaper Basic or Plus subscriptions but lose out on professional monitoring, backup internet, and more.

 Unfortunately, the Alarm Pro is not without quirks. You have to deal with multiple apps, and there is no keyfob to quickly arm or disarm the system. You can, however, use Ring's [Geofencing](https://activate-lock.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-unlock-icloud-lock-on-your-apple-iphone-12-pro-and-ipad-by-drfone-ios/) feature to get a notification every time you are away from the property and haven't armed the system. Moreover, you need a subscription to save footage locally from connected Ring cameras.

You'll also be happy that AI-based motion detection features and activity zones are available without a subscription. That said, there is optional [subscription-based cloud storage](https://www.tplinkcloud.com/) if you change your mind in the future.

 One of the highlights of the TP-Link camera is its video quality. It captures clear and detailed video in both daylight and nighttime thanks to a larger image sensor and an f/1.0 aperture lens. Other features include support for QHD resolution, IP66 dust and water resistance, two-way audio, and a 127-degree field of view.

 The C323WB is also easy to install and comes with a three-meter-long power cable, making it much more flexible in mounting locations. Moreover, the company supplies the necessary screws and mounting hardware in the box. Wi-Fi is available regarding connectivity options, but you can also use an [Ethernet cable](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-extract-and-save-fb-videos-the-cutting-edge-of-top-5/) for a more stable connection.

### How do I install my security camera?

[Security camera installation](https://phone-solutions.techidaily.com/guide-on-how-to-erase-iphone-15-pro-max-devices-entirely-drfone-by-drfone-ios-full-data-eraser-ios-full-data-eraser/) is typically a simple DIY project. Manufacturers include everything you may need, apart from tools like drills, screwdrivers, or hammers. You just have to decide on the placement, mark its position, drill the holes for any wires or screws, and mount the camera. If your camera needs power, ensure its placement is within a couple of feet of a power outlet.

### How do I power my outdoor security camera?

 You'll find [two types of outdoor security cameras](https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/harmonious-hearing-eargasm-review-of-earmuffs/) on the market. Some cameras have a built-in battery that needs charging every few weeks or months. These cameras don't need constant power. But for outdoor security cameras that don't have a battery, you'll need to plug them into a wall outlet for power.

### Where should I mount my outdoor security camera?

 Doors, driveways, and any obscure areas that can act as entry points are usually great places to start. But depending on the layout of your home or property and what you want to be covered by the camera, you can pick a vantage point. It's also a good idea to mount the cameras eight to ten feet from the ground.

### Can outdoor security cameras be used indoors?

 Outdoor security cameras can be used indoors. In fact, camera manufacturers typically market them for both. But in case you want to place an outdoor security camera on a table or some other place rather than mounting it on a wall, you may have to buy an optional stand.
