 Your pets bring you tons of love and joy, and you want to do everything you can to keep them happy and healthy. As technology continues to integrate into our lives, it's no surprise that your furry friends haven't been left out of the conversation. Here are five gadgets that are sure to help you care for your dogs and cats.

## 1  Whisker's Litter-Robot 

 One of my favorite pet products of all time, Whisker's [Litter-Robot](https://www.amazon.com/Litter-Robot-Bundle-Whisker-Black-Self-Cleaning/dp/B0CQKPZRFP?ref%5F=ast%5Fsto%5Fdp&th=1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004111&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-that-make-pet-ownership-so-much-easier%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) makes one of the less glamorous parts of pet ownership much more pleasant. It worked so well at my home that we now have two units for our three cats, and after many years of constant use, I can't recommend it enough. 

![Cat using a black Litter-Robot 4.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/cat-using-litter-robot-4-black.jpg) 

Whisker Litter-Robot

 Of course, the Litter-Robot's main appeal is ease of cleaning. Instead of having to scoop litter like you would with an ordinary litter box, waste collects in a lined tray underneath the unit, which can be easily removed and disposed of. The buttons are extremely user-friendly, and it's simple to recycle or reset the Litter-Robot if necessary.

 Beyond just handling your cat's litter for you, it comes with the incredible Whisker app that gives you tons of information. You can see the level of litter left, how close it is to being full, and be notified directly if there are any issues. It even keeps a very detailed use log, tracking the weight of each cat that uses the litter box and how often they do so. The Litter Robot emphasizes pet safety, and pauses all mechanical operations when a cat is inside or poking around.

Whisker

 If you're sick of scooping litter, or just want a little more insight into your cat's bathroom habits, I highly recommend Whisker's Litter-Robot 4.

## 2  Furbo 360 Dog/Cat Camera 

[Furbo's 360 Pet Camera](https://www.amazon.com/Furbo-Camera-with-360Â°-View/dp/B09GDQZLD1/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=32B71S0ZP3BW4&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.m8gY8KuH-W0mWk%5F6kzquDp47NRmlGuvSVlssE8mM%5F5bbpr8ZdYo7ScHRN9FAPVsrATPRnv%5FJlVF583%5F4Qaut1BNDjNSAZPu4dRyrsPs2Wg4oafhvbcoRzre6yY08zs5oGMZE7r4WxjYNF7olbE-Q6yO1xrwWGrLga253LotLt8FJUeb8oAd0ke5oLMKZz1w1qOe5xjLwR1tS5QiBDSv4veEpz-4EEP30GMvWXx9x%5F9Qv%5FKPeS46EnA0tShZ6tWj-QnWrg51H8rlU8e4tLxcwTz4Q3RSkLje5m9jKVVXxhZo.7H%5FCHWLP22wYvpFgUewuVVRKx3EqAmgog2LlrymX9FI&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=furbo+treat+camera&qid=1720815976&s=pet-supplies&sprefix=furbo+treat+camera%2Cpets%2C90&sr=1-1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004111&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-that-make-pet-ownership-so-much-easier%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) is my favorite way to keep an eye on my pets when I'm away. Besides allowing you to look at your pets no matter where they are in your room, you can interact with them too. The camera rotates to track your cat automatically, and comes with a speaker that lets you speak to them while you're away. Furbo has gone above and beyond with their fully rotating camera, adding a new star feature: the app-controlled treat dispenser. The connected app even lets you customize the sound it makes when a treat is dispensed. Though this may not be the most necessary feature for a pet camera, my cats definitely appreciate it.

 With all of these features, alongside bark/meow notifications and great camera quality, the Furbo 360 Camera is the best cat camera I've tried. It's perfect for pet owners who worry about the wellbeing of their animals while away.

## 3  SureFlap Microchip Pet Door 

![White dog exiting a home through the SureFlap Smart Pet Door.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-11-at-3-04-36-pm.png)

SureFlapp / Sure PetCare

 Technology has even made significant improvements to the traditional cat/dog door flap. If you've got a pet that loves to explore the great outdoors, the Sure PetCare's [SureFlap Microchip Pet Door](https://www.amazon.com/SureFlap-Microchip-Pet-Door-White/dp/B009NH6NR0?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004111&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-that-make-pet-ownership-so-much-easier%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) is a great option. Designed for cats and small dogs, the door comes with tons of features that make this flap safer and more convenient than traditional pet flaps.

 You can ensure that only your pets are able to enter your home using the door's inbuilt microchip reader. Though any pet can exit your home through the door, you can lock the door to prevent all exits at any time. You can also schedule a curfew, which means the door will automatically lock and unlock at whatever time you set. Though my cats aren't big fans of going outside, I'd certainly go with SureFlap if they were.

## 4  PETLIBRO One RFID Pet Feeder 

![PETLIBRO One RFID individual pet feeder, collar, and iPhone app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-11-at-3-15-42-pm.png) 

PETLIBRO

 If you have multiple pets at home, you know how tricky feeding time can be. Uneven eating can result in one pet overeating and another not getting enough, which is certainly the case in my household! The [One RFID Pet Feeder](https://www.amazon.com/PETLIBRO-Automatic-Control-Activated-Dispenser/dp/B0CKZ9JKRJ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004111&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-that-make-pet-ownership-so-much-easier%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) solves these issues, and allows you to tailor your pet's feeding times and amounts individually.

 The One RFID Pet Feeder works by identifying your pet's unique collar and only unlocking when it is at the feeder, preventing your other pets from accessing their food. This is especially useful if your pets are on specific diets. Beyond customizing the kind of food that is dispensed, you can also set the amount and feeding time for each unit. Where this pet feeder really shines is in the PETLIBRO smartphone app. Beyond allowing you to adjust the feeder settings and assign them to pets, it also provides valuable insights into your pet's eating habits, including how long they ate for and how many times they visited the feeder. This is a great gadget for keeping your pet's diet on track or if you're the forgetful type.

## 5  Tracktive GPS Tracker 

![Dog wearing Tractive GPS collar showing its location and path on a map.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/screenshot-2024-07-11-at-3-34-19-pm.png) 

Tractive

 If you have particularly adventurous pets, you might be worried about where they end up during their outdoor adventures. [Tracktive's GPS Tracker](https://www.amazon.com/tractive-TRNJADB-Dog-Tracker-4/dp/B099SF2X9L/ref=sr%5F1%5F1?crid=2CLYXMEO54VAL&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.gS01ULY4iEwrcwB0VXduT1PAXlzvaDbCqQbpTeiMJM3yB9OnPewMBq2ZL-qEZW4GX9dRurzMaCUQiuFL9yum7gu%5F6MvMmHvawTa1NE2stweb4gHVuq97AZzjLupOkLJxh0lRzGASeoLz-xFeGqxcz0rzN5Xd%5FNbmAXf9Za6t7c0p8T0Mo%5FylvUCdAzmA4fgaPpDdIzE6rgdwpVpdwLrUX9b7SrHdlkYX6C64LUu2ZG40mbHrcmv3QSXoSM6eN-CSBZu4QprgTt9lSjTB8OvCViwSxmlBtlj-KjRjFHUdwt0.QH2dC%5F0vHrEVlKsnxFchmcpScaQDzcMJNJ4xtAcsCFw&dib%5Ftag=se&keywords=tractive+gps+dog+tracker&qid=1720816078&s=pet-supplies&sprefix=tractive%2Cpets%2C110&sr=1-1&tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004111&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fgadgets-that-make-pet-ownership-so-much-easier%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Evergreen) lets you follow your pet's every move, and know their location no matter where they end up.

 Beyond just showing you your pet's location when you check the app, it can also alert you if your pet leaves your "virtual fence", which you can designate in the Tractive app. Beyond this peace of mind, my favorite feature is the collar's live health tracking. Even animals that don't get outside much can benefit from wearing a Tractive collar, as its health and monitoring features are useful for any pet owner. The app will alert you if your pet is less active than usual, as this can be a sign of a health issue, alongside the length and quality of their sleep.

---

 Though your pets may not be particularly appreciative of today's incredible technology, you can certainly use it to improve the way you take care of them. From how you feed them to tracking them anywhere in the world, these gadgets can take your pet ownership to the next level. We're already happy to have smart devices all over our homes to make our own lives easier, so why not extend the same benefits to the furry members of your family?
