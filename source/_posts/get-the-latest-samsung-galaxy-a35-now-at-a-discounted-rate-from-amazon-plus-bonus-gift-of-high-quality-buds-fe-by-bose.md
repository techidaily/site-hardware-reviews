The Samsung Galaxy A35 on-offer for the bundle comes with 128GB of internal storage, but if you ever need more space, it supports up to a 1TB microSD card. It also uses an AMOLED display for great color, contrast, and detailing. It features a 13MP front-facing camera, while the rear of the phone has 8MP ultra-wide, 50MP wide-angle, and 5MP macro lenses, allowing you to create various photography styles on a single device. It's even IP67-rated for water and dust resistance, so you won't have to worry about a bit of rain or spilled water destroying your new phone.

The Buds FE are a relatively affordable pair of wireless earbuds from Samsung, offering a mid-range option for customers looking for premium features like active noise cancellation without the premium price. They feature a redesigned wingtip for a more comfortable and secure fit inside your ear so you can enjoy your music, podcasts, and videos and less time hunting for your earbuds on the couch. With Tap Connect, you can instantly pair the earbuds to your Samsung smartphone, tablet, or smartwatch, or you can pair them with two devices simultaneously and flip between them with the auto switch feature. This makes them an excellent option for anyone who has separate devices for work and personal use and doesn't want the hassle of disconnecting and reconnecting earbuds every time you switch devices.

Don't miss a chance to nab this Samsung [bundle offer](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-A35-Unlocked-Smartphone-Expandable/dp/B0CYRGHDRV?th=1&tag=zdnet-buy-button-20) while you still can. 

## When will this deal expire?

The Amazon listing for the Galaxy A35 and Buds FE bundle doesn't have an expiration countdown or "limited time deal" tag, but that doesn't mean that this deal will last forever. There may be limited stock available for this bundle at this price, or Samsung may change the terms of the deal at some point in the future (and not necessarily for the good of your wallet), so you won't want to wait to snag this bundle.
