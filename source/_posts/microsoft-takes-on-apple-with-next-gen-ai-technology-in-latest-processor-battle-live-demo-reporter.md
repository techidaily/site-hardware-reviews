## Microsoft Takes on Apple with Next-Gen AI Technology in Latest Processor Battle – Live Demo  Reporter

Microsoft's upcoming line of Surface Pro and Surface laptops are expected to come with Qualcomm's new [Snapdragon X Elite](https://www.zdnet.com/article/qualcomms-snapdragon-x-elite-brings-more-ai-power-to-your-next-pc/) processors, making waves with impressive performance metrics that could rival, or even surpass, Apple's flagship MacBooks, which have long sat at the [top of the food chain](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/). 

Launching in late Spring 2024, Microsoft is apparently so confident in the performance of Qualcomm's new ARM-powered chips for Windows, [The Verge reports](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24116587/microsoft-macbook-air-surface-arm-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite), that its soon-to-be-released line of Surface tablets and laptops will be at the forefront of a big push for [AI-powered](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-ai-heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence/) computing.

If 2024 is the year for AI's full integration into PCs, ARM-powered Windows is part of that overarching design. The ARM architecture refers to the physical design of the processor that largely powers devices like smartphones, tablets, and notably, Apple's processors. These chips bring a lot of advantages over the traditional x86 processors produced by Intel and AMD, most notably less power consumption alongside cutting-edge performance.

I recently had a chance to see the Snapdragon X Elite series at a demo event hosted by Qualcomm, which definitely made some big claims in terms of their performance, particularly as positioned against Apple's M3 silicon. These improvements aren't just theoretical projections up against emerging AI technology but easy-to-understand metrics that laptop consumers are concerned about now, such as boot-up speed and app launch speed, not to mention the significant reduction in power consumption, which means smaller designs that run cooler and featuring batteries that last longer. 

**Also: [For the age of the AI PC, here comes a new test of speed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/for-the-age-of-the-ai-pc-here-comes-a-new-test-of-speed/)**

Up until now, Windows laptops and PCs have run almost exclusively on Intel and AMD chips, but Microsoft's replacement of Intel Core Ultra processors in the new line of consumer Surface Pro and Surface laptop with the Snapdragon X Elite chips signals an industry change, not just in manufacturers' confidence in Qualcomm's product, but a potential new norm for new devices. 

When the The Snapdragon X Elite was announced in October 2023, Qualcomm claimed it was 21% faster than Apple's M3 chip in a multi-core CPU performance benchmark. However, questions still remain about the Snapdragon X Elite's thermal capabilities, as they will likely run hotter than Apple's M3 chips and require cooling fans. Apple, on the other hand, has the ability to optimize every element of its chipset's design as the maker of both the hardware and the operating system.

This new series of devices running Qualcomm processors will likely be the first ones to gain access to Windows 11's cutting-edge AI functionalities. The Snapdragon X series features a large amount of space dedicated to neural processing, resulting in what may be among the fastest AI-powered devices on the market.

Running Windows on ARM architecture won't all be smooth sailing, as there will likely be some ironing out of compatibility issues with certain apps (particularly with gaming). Emulating applications designed for the x86 platform should be seamless, for the most part. 

Microsoft banking on the Snapdragon X series' performance seems, to us, just one part of a larger picture. CEO Satya Nadella will likely elaborate on Windows 11 infused with AI-powered tasks at a special Windows and Surface AI event on May 20, just ahead of Build 2024\.
