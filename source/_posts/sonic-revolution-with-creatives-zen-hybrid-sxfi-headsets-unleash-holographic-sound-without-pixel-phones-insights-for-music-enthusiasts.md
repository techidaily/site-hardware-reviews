These headphones are crazy comfortable but slightly frustrating for Pixel phone users.

The last time I reviewed a pair of Creative Headphones (earbuds, actually), I was blown away by the sound, feeling as if the company was onto something special. The earbuds in question were the [Aurvana Ace 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-listened-to-wireless-earbuds-with-xmems-drivers-and-theyve-set-a-new-standard-for-me/). That was another instance where I wondered if a new technology (xMEMS) was a gimmick. 

Turns out it very much wasn't.

So, when Creative's PR sent me a pair of headphones with what _could_ be yet another gimmick, I was excited to see what was what.

The "gimmick" in question is Spatial Holography. According to Creative, the idea is to "Recreate the same expansive depth, details, and soundstage of an immersive multi-speaker system on headphones."

Intriguing.

As you might expect, I had my doubts, especially given [these headphones run for only $99](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCreative-Wireless-Headphones-Technology-Cancellation%2Fdp%2FB0D5MPGTJ4%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C36f9cd76-1451-4893-a35f-fc9d4a58b62d%7Cdtp&dtb=1) on Amazon. Even with those doubts, I was sure Creative would deliver on some level.

Let's find out how the Zen Hybrid SXFI fared.

## My experience

As always, my first test was to fire up "Analog Kid" by Rush on my Pixel 8 Pro. The SXFI Spatial Holography is enabled out of the box, so when the intro to the song kicked in, I was taken aback. My initial thought was that it sounded as though Creative applied a bit of reverb to give it a more immersive sound. It was almost like listening to studio music in a concert setting, or using headphones with a surround sound effect.

At first, I didn't like the effect, so I switched it off. With Spatial Holography off, I could hear what the headphones were truly capable of, which was quite good: bass was tighter (which is always important when listening to Rush), mids were toned down a bit, and highs had a bit more sizzle.

After that first test, I connected the headphones to the Creative app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creative.apps.creative) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/creative/id1527733228)), not knowing there was also an app to customize the SXFI profile ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.creative.apps.superxfiplayer&pli=1) and [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1323992913)). I don't usually like counting on apps to improve the sound of headphones and earbuds, but this had me intrigued.

The Zen Hybrid SXFI headphones have easy access buttons and plush ear cushions.

Before all that, I decided to upgrade the firmware for the headphones, and let me tell you that took far longer than I expected. The firmware transfer was stuck at 3% for so long that I assumed something was wrong. During that process, I wasn't able to use, interact with, or turn off the headphones. After 15 minutes of waiting for the transfer to get beyond 3%, I grew concerned. If I've learned anything over the years, however, it's that you do not mess with firmware updates, so I allowed it to continue.

And continue.

And continue.

And continue.

Lunchtime!

I decided to let those wheels keep spinning while my wife and I went out for lunch. 

Unfortunately, the Creative app still doesn't function well with Pixel phones. I ran into this same problem with the [Aurvana Ace 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-listened-to-wireless-earbuds-with-xmems-drivers-and-theyve-set-a-new-standard-for-me/) earbuds and eventually gave up on trying to connect the app to the earbuds. Fortunately, after restarting the headphones, they finally connected.

Instead of updating the firmware, I decided to try the SXFI app. The first thing it asks you to do (after creating an account) is map your head. You're supposed to allow the phone to snap a photo of your right ear, your face, and then your left ear. Snapping a photo of your ears is _not_ easy. On top of that, it's not clear whether the photo will happen automatically or if you have to tap a shutter button. If you've ever tried to tap a button on your phone screen when you can't see said screen, you understand how challenging that can be.

So, I had to have my wife do the head mapping. It turns out that you have to arrange the phone so that your ears line up in a very specific way, which you cannot do yourself. Once that was taken care of, I assumed there'd be customizations offered.

**Also: [Focal made wired headphones cool again for me - with impressive style and sound](https://www.zdnet.com/article/focal-made-wired-headphones-cool-again-for-me-with-impressive-style-and-sound/)**

Nope. Not with my Pixel phone. I couldn't even adjust the EQ because the app doesn't support Pixel devices. This shouldn't surprise me, given my problems when reviewing previous Creative products and trying to use my Pixel 8 Pro with Creative's apps.

Ergo, I had to review this based on the default sound. Fortunately, the Zen Hybrid SXFI headphones deliver on that front. These headphones are not audiophile quality, but for $99 they still impress. Sadly, the Spatial Holography is kind of a loss on Pixel devices because you can't really do any customizations. So, I switched the feature off and just let the headphones do their thing.

Although the sound did have a bit more mids than I prefer, I came away feeling like these headphones want to live in the range of studio monitors. The sound leans toward neutral, without heavy-handed lows or highs. They don't quite reach studio monitor status because you can definitely hear a good amount of processing going on, which precludes them from being truly neutral. With the Spatial Holography on, the headphones are as far from neutral as you can get.

## ZDNET's buying advice

I really wanted to love these headphones. They're comfortable, offer fantastic battery life, and can connect wirelessly or via a wire. If Creative could solve the issue with their apps and Pixel phones, I'm guessing the experience would be considerably better. Because of that, I would not recommend these headphones to anyone planning on connecting them to a Pixel device. If your phone of choice is made by a company that isn't Google, you might have a wonderful experience with these headphones.

The good news is the basic sound from the [Zen Hybrid SXFI](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCreative-Wireless-Headphones-Technology-Cancellation%2Fdp%2FB0D5MPGTJ4%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C36f9cd76-1451-4893-a35f-fc9d4a58b62d%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is on par with about every headphone I've ever reviewed at this price point. So, if you're looking for a very comfortable pair of over-the-ear headphones with long-lasting battery life, and you aren't looking for audiophile-quality sound, these babies fit the bill. Otherwise, look elsewhere.
