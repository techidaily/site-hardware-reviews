When ZDNET reviewed Dell's XPS 15 in [2020](https://www.zdnet.com/product/dell-xps-15-9500/), we described it as setting "a new high bar' for 15.6-inch laptops," while the [2021](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dell-xps-15-9510-its-good-to-be-king/) model was dubbed "the standard against which other laptops are measured." Clearly, it still carries a premium price tag, even with $700 shaved off the list price, but you're getting a top-notch configuration that will suit a wide range of demanding professionals.
