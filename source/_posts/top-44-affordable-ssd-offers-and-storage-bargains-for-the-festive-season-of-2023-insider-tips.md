## Top Pick: Ultimate Guide to the Fastest & Reliable RAM Modules of 2023 for Productivity & Play - Insights

Whether you're [building a PC from scratch](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-build-a-gaming-pc-for-550/) or upgrading components as your needs change, RAM is an important piece of the puzzle. Upgrading your computer's RAM capacity can help increase speed and power efficiency, meaning you'll have an easier time multitasking in different programs. It can also help keep vital machine parts operating at optimal temperatures. 

When shopping for RAM, it's important to note whether you'll be using it in a desktop, laptop, or server, as RAM options for each differ greatly. Laptops and desktops have different connector-pin configurations, which means that RAM can't be used interchangeably between them. RAM intended for servers is also very different, as server memory is designed to run systems for multiple computers or networks. Server RAM is also designed with protection redundancy like error-correcting code and thermal sensors to ensure data integrity as well as performance.

I researched the top RAM options based on price, use case, and performance. My pick for the best RAM overall is the [G.Skill RipJaws S5](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FG-Skill-RipJaws-288-Pin-CL30-40-40-96-F5-6000J3040F16GA2-RS5K%2Fdp%2FB09Y16CDLG%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C341cfb2a-bb4c-4008-b035-2a2ae79b8710%7Cdtp&dtb=1) \-- with memory bundles up to 96GB and base clock speeds up to 6,000MHz, this RAM is great for office and creative work as well as gaming. Keep reading below to find out more about the G.Skill RipJaws S5 as well as my other picks for the best RAM.

## Which RAM is right for you?

The most important thing to keep in mind while shopping for RAM to build or upgrade your PC with is: how are you going to use your computer?

Not all RAM is created equal. If you're building or upgrading a gaming PC, you'll want an option that offers at least 16GB of memory as well as base speeds in the 3,600 to 4,000MHz range. For work and home use PCs, 8GB of RAM is plenty of memory for streaming and web browsing. You'll also be able to save a bit of money by choosing RAM with lower base speeds or older, DDR4 options.

If you're wanting to set up or upgrade a server, you'll want to choose a RAM option that uses sticks that are factory-matched and tested for data integrity, speed consistency, and durability.

| **Buy this best RAM...**      | **If you need...**                                                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| G.Skill RipJaws S5            | A well-rounded RAM choice for work or gaming. This matched pair has a max speed of 6000MHz and a capacity of 32GB.                                                   |
| Corsair Vengeance SODIMM DDR5 | A RAM upgrade for your work or gaming laptop. The Corsair Vengeance DDR5 laptop RAM is compatible with both Intel and AMD chipsets.                                  |
| G.Skill Trident Z RGB         | A RAM upgrade for your gaming desktop. The G.Skill Trident Z RGB features customizable lighting to match your other peripherals and components.                      |
| Kingston Fury Renegade Pro    | A RAM upgrade for a dedicated server. This bundle includes four 32GB RAM sticks, each of which is pre-registered as server memory to streamline the upgrade process. |
| Patriot Signature             | A budget-friendly RAM upgrade. The 2-8GB stick bundle retails for under $50.                                                                                         |

## How did I choose each RAM?

While researching RAM for this best list, I kept these criteria in mind:

* **Price:** RAM, like most PC components, can cost as much or as little as you want to spend. Many brands offer single-stick or bundle options at varying price points to help you choose the memory bandwidth that best fits your needs as well as your budget.
* **Use cases:** As I mentioned above, not all RAM is created equal. Along with traditional desktop and laptop RAM options, I also made sure to include RAM bundles intended for enterprise and server use.
* **Performance:** Each option on this list has been researched to ensure that the RAM conforms to minimum system requirements for popular programs like web browsers, Adobe Creative Cloud, and gaming.

## Should I use all four RAM slots? Or leave two open?

You can absolutely use all four RAM slots on your motherboard, but there's a caveat. If you want to use all four RAM slots, make sure that you purchase a set of four RAM sticks. Bundles of RAM are often tested and matched together based on base clock speeds. If you install one or two RAM sticks and then go in later with a different brand or clock speed, it could cause some performance issues.

If one pair of RAM sticks are rated for lower clock speeds than the other, your computer will try to match all four RAM to the lower speed. Usually this doesn't cause major issues, but you may see some stuttering while playing demanding games or multitasking in work programs.

## Is 64GB of RAM too much?

For most people, 64GB of RAM is absolutely overkill. Even for a decent gaming PC, most users won't need more than 16GB. Content creators who use streaming or recording software while playing games and creative professionals who work in 3D modeling or video programs may need 64GB of RAM to help render finished videos, photos, and models (and some workstations have up to 128GB of RAM, but these are usually reserved for PC rigs used for professional filmmaking, game production, or super-computing).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Is DDR4 RAM still good?

If you're shopping for new RAM to drop into your PC and wonder what the difference between DDR4 and DDR5 is: it's basically an indicator of hardware generation. While DDR4 is an older form-factor, it's still a viable option -- especially if you're looking to save a bit of cash. You can still find motherboards and CPUs that support DDR4 RAM, and you'll get similar base and overclocking results as newer DDR5 products. Though you may see performance issues in asset-heavy programs like Photoshop.

## Are there alternative RAM picks worth considering?

There are plenty of brands that offer both budget-friendly and high-end, high-performance RAM options for work and gaming PCs. Here's a short list of options that I thought were great:
