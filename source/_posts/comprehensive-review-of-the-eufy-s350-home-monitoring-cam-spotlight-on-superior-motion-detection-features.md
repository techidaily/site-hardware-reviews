##  Tell Me It Doesn’t Look Like a Little Robot

![The Eufy Security Indoor Cam S350 powered on via USB-C and connected to Eufy app.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/eufy-security-indoor-cam-s350-powered-on-via-usb-c-cable-and-connected-to-eufy-appjpg_53511169588_o.jpg)

 First impressions matter, right? If your own judgments are based on the S350’s marketing, you may walk away with incorrect assumptions; chiefly, that the camera is wire-free. That’s not the case, though the reality isn’t too tough to bear. Like most other indoor smart cams (and we've got [a big roundup](https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-enhance-your-game-experience-with-these-5-screen-capture-techniques-for-minecraft-mac/) of these), the little camera comes with a USB cable and power adapter.

 At just about 4 inches tall and 3 inches wide, I had no issue placing the S350 in several areas of my home. If you don’t want to go tabletop, there are keyholes on the bottom of the base for wall or ceiling mount applications. Conveniently, it’s also quite lightweight.

 Cosmetically, the S350 does a good job of calling attention to itself. I can see the white, gray, and black shell colors as nice deterrents for would-be thieves looking to rummage through dresser drawers.

![Bottom of the Eufy Security Indoor Cam S350](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/bottom-of-the-eufy-security-indoor-cam-s350-has-rubber-feetjpg_53510112187_o.jpg) 

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 The S350’s rotatable base is smaller than the camera body but doesn’t struggle to hold it upright. I didn’t encounter any notable resistance when tilting the S350 up and down, and its rotation felt just as natural. A wire passthrough on the bottom of the base keeps the cabling corralled while providing a clear path to the USB-C port. You’ll also find a sync button hanging out here.

 If local storage is your preference (Eufy's cloud storage would be your other option), the S350’s microSD card slot supports up to 128GB and is located toward the bottom-right of the cam. ​​​

##  A Stunning 4K Experience

 When it comes to in-home [security systems](https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/increase-your-videos-impact-essential-keyword-analysis-resources/), the S350 isn’t your average indoor smart cam. Eufy’s dream machine is outfitted with not one, but two lenses: a 4K wide-angle and a 2K telephoto for all your zooming needs. How does the glass translate to actual image quality, you may be wondering? Quite admirably.

 This is easily some of the best-looking footage I’ve ever seen from an indoor cam, and I’ve been reviewing these types of devices for some time now. The below image was taken during daylight hours with minimal lamp light in the room, with resolution maxed out to 4K. Vibrant and colorful, but not overly saturated, the S350 consistently delivered crisp-clear visuals.

![4K resolution on the Eufy Security Indoor Cam S350](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/eufy-security-cam-s350-4k-1.jpeg)

 In the Eufy app, you’ll be able to choose between several resolution settings. By default, the S350 is set to auto, adjusting pixel count in real time based on factors like lighting, available bandwidth, and battery life. I’ve attached three more screenshots to showcase 2K, 1080p, and 720p visuals.

![2K resolution on the Eufy Security Indoor Cam S350](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/eufy-security-cam-s350-2k-1.jpeg)

 The S350’s 360-degree panning, 75-degree tilting, and hybrid zoom functions worked without a hassle too. You’ll be hard-pressed to hear the camera rotating, even in the quietest of rooms.

 The 2K telephoto lens gets in nice and close on subjects without any kind of pixelation taking place. When zooming, I noted a few times that the S350 didn’t seem to know what was important to focus on. As you can see in the image below, the lens opted to highlight the lettering on my chair, as opposed to the handsome Husky sitting on it.

![Telephoto zoom on the Eufy Security Indoor Cam S350](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/eufy-security-cam-s350-telephoto-1.jpeg)

 The S350 also delivers solid IR night vision, illuminating subjects up to 40 feet away, and faces up to 30 feet.

![IR night vision on the Eufy Security Indoor Cam S350](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/eufy-security-cam-s350-ir-night-vision-1.jpeg)

##  Motion Detection Meets Snappy AI

![Activity Zones in the Eufy app](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/eufy-security-cam-s350-activity-zones-1.jpeg) 

Michael Bizzaco / How-To Geek

 Next to its terrific image quality, another huge win for the S350 is its ultra-responsive motion detection. Powered by the kind of AI tech that can tell the difference between humans, animals, and miscellaneous movements, I was blown away by how effective the S350 was at tracking motion. I literally marched around my living room and was able to watch the S350 follow my every step. Frankly, it was a bit creepy!

 The Eufy Security App lets you adjust how sensitive the S350 is too. Even when set one notch above the “Lowest” level, I received _a ton_ of notifications from the camera. I recommend creating some Activity Zones in the app to help cut down on how many alerts the S350 sends to your smartphones and tablets.

##  Loud and Clear

![The The Eufy Security Indoor Cam S350 with mounting plate screws and USB-C cable in front of box](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/06/eufy-security-indoor-cam-s350-with-mounting-plate-screws-and-usb-c-cable-in-front-of-boxjpg_53511002581_o.jpg) 

Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 The S350 checks all the boxes in the audio department. I ran some test audio from my MacBook at 50% volume in both my master bedroom (about 30 feet away from the S350’s main testing location) and office (around 40 feet away). Both sound tests were a bit muffled when listening through the Eufy app, but I could still tell the difference between vocals and instruments through the S350 mic.

 Most importantly, human voices in the same room as the camera were full-bodied and plenty loud. The sound of my own voice booming through the S350 speaker was sufficiently audible, albeit a bit compressed.

##  Using the Eufy Security App

Close 

 I’ve had a few run-ins with the Eufy Security App (for [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/eufy-security/id1424956516) and [Android](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003545/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oceanwing.battery.cam&hl=en%5FUS) devices) before, so I’ve had some time to get acquainted with some of its quirks. Unfortunately, this isn’t a surveillance dashboard that other companies should be jealous of; but it definitely works, and is packed with customizations and other useful settings. That being said, I think I’ll cover the cons before I hit on the pros.

 First of all, it irked me that flipping my iPhone to the side didn’t automatically switch the S350 live view over to landscape mode. Instead, there’s a landscape button in the bottom-right corner of the screen that you have to press. When you’re in landscape mode, you have to press a left-arrow button at the top-left of the screen to go back to portrait.

 My other big gripe is that several key settings weren’t front and center in the UI. For example, “Motion Detection,” “Notifications,” and “Audio” sub-menus required a tap of the “Settings” button to access. It’s not the biggest issue in the world, but other companies ([like Arlo](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-essential-knowledge-for-saving-app-activity/)) include easy-access widgets for some of these important settings as soon as you open the app.

 Now the good stuff! The Eufy Security App allows you to customize the S350 to accommodate both your living conditions, schedule, and smart home tech. Having the ability to adjust what type of notifications the S350 will send you is a huge plus; for while it’s nice to see Rover darting about via app, receiving a ping every time he crosses the field of view can get pretty annoying.

 I also really liked having the option to see live views from just the wide-angle lens, or from both the wide and the telephoto. Do keep in mind that enabling dual view does cap the resolution at 2K for both lenses.

 The S350 works with Alexa and Google Home. I had no issue adding the EufySecurity skill to Alexa and was able to pull a live view of the S350 and use two-way audio features, both through the Alexa app and my Echo Show 5\. I also successfully created an Alexa Routine to turn my desk lamp on whenever the S350 detected motion.
