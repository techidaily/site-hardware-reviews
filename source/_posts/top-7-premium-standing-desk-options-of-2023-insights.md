## Vari Electric Standing Desk

### Best standing desk overall

**Specs:** Operates at 45 decibels | Holds up to 200 pounds | 25-50.5 inches

The Vari Electric is the best standing desk overall that many reviewers stand by.

It's ideal for individuals up to 6 feet 6 inches tall -- with the adjustable frame going from 25.5 inches to 50.5 inches tall. There are fewer options in terms of the size of the desk, as the only choice is between a 48-inch or 60-inch long desktop that is 30 inches wide. It can handle weights of up to 250 pounds and has a motor that operates at under 45 decibels. 

Plus, the desk is really easy to set up. In fact, Vari claims that the installation process takes as little as five minutes. The Vari Electric Standing Desk comes in five colors, as well as stunning wood finishes like Butcher Block, Reclaimed Wood, and Darkwood.

Pros 
* Wealth of customizable options
* Spans as wide as 80 inches
* Desktop and legs are sturdy and durable

Cons 
* Can get pricey the more that you add
* Installation process is a multi-person job

## FlexiSpot E7 Pro Plus Electric Standing Desk

### Best large standing desk

**Specs:** Nearly every part is customizable | Holds up to 355 pounds | 48-80 inches

FlexiSpot is one of the more reputable home office brands out there -- and for good reason. One of the company's latest models, the E7 Pro Plus, is a fully-customizable, pick-your-part, electric standing desk that we'd argue is also the best multifunctional option on the market. For example, you can upgrade the furniture with a cable management cord, a side drawer for tools, and even W1 casters for improved mobility.

The desk comes in sizes that range from 48-inch widths to 80 inches. Ultimately, the setup process for the table depends on the size and how many spare parts you purchase, but if you're going to invest in a desk that does more than just switch between sit and stand modes, the FlexiSpot E7 Pro Plus is worth your consideration.

### Best adjustable standing desk

**Specs:** Anti-collision feature | Holds up to 335 pounds | 24.3-49.9 inches 

The Uplift V2 Standing Desk is among the list of top-rated standing desks. Two factors help make it stand out: Its sturdy, functional design and endless options for customization. The desk can be adjusted between 25.3 and 50.9 inches tall, but a commercial version of the V2 frame that lowers the desk by 2 inches also is available, making the height range 23.5 inches to 50.9 inches. 

Many reviewers have remarked that the Uplift V2 is extremely sturdy at any height. The desk's height is controlled through a keypad on the desk, and the motor is said to be quiet. The desk also has a nifty anti-collision feature that stops the desk from raising or lowering if it hits something. 

One of the best features of the Uplift is you can tailor it to your specific needs. All models are 30 inches deep but range in length from 42 inches to 80 inches. Like the aforementioned FlexiSpot desk, you also have the option to add wire grommets or power outlets to the desk. The desktop itself comes in 21 styles, and even the electric keypad that controls the height is available in three different options.

## Fully Jarvis Bamboo standing desk

### Best eco-friendly standing desk

**Specs:** 4 color options | Holds up to 350 pounds | 27-30 inches

The Fully Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk has an adjustable frame with generous dimensions recommended for those between 5'1" and 7'1" tall. There is a customizable width of 30 inches to 72 inches and depth options of 27 inches to 30 inches to help you find the best fit for your working style and space. The desk has a 350-pound lifting capacity, making it hard for the average user to overload it.

### Best mobile standing desk

**Specs:** Lockable castor wheels | Holds up to 15 pounds | 20.5-32 inches

This is a true bargain version of a standing desk. It has a wood desktop that measures 23.6 inches by 16 inches. The height can be adjusted to anywhere between 20.5 inches to 33 inches tall. You do have to adjust the height manually using a twist-lock knob, which might make switching back and forth between sitting and standing a little more cumbersome. 

Still, this desk costs under $75, making it an affordable option for many users. It's sturdy, and thanks to lockable castor wheels, it's pretty portable. If you're just looking for something so you can stand and work for a few minutes at a time throughout the day, then this might be the best option for you.

This is another affordable option. The SHW Height Adjustable Mobile Laptop Stand has a no-frills design that's built for functionality. Its height can be adjusted between 28 inches and 33 inches tall. It uses a locking knob to adjust the height. Its desktop is a little wider than the Seville Classics desk cart at 26 inches.

## Uplift E7 Electric Standing Desk Converter

### Best standing desk converter

**Specs:** Built-in electric keypad | Holds up to 110 pounds | 21 inches, plus desk height

This is another affordable standing desk option. It's best if you already have a work desk that you love. The E7 sits on top of an existing table and adds up to 21 inches of height. The desktop itself measures 30 inches long by 21.5 inches deep. It has a built-in electric keypad, which controls the desk's height and can be programmed to save the heights you prefer. 

The E7 also offers single or dual mounts for your monitors. It's capable of lifting up to 110 pounds. It has a detachable tiered keyboard tray, which means your keyboard and mouse can stay at hand level while the monitor is higher up at eye level. 

The desk surface comes in four colors (black, white, bamboo, and rubberwood), while the base and monitor mounts are only available in black and white.

## How did we choose these standing desks?

There are several factors to consider when choosing the best standing desk for you. 

* **Height**: Both size and height are two major factors that help to ensure a desk is the right fit. Taller individuals may require higher desks than a more petite user.
* **Size**: It is also important to consider the kind of work you do, as some users may require more surface space than others.
* **Stability**: A desk's stability is critical to ensure that your equipment is not damaged while your desk is in use.
* **Sound level**: Some electric desks may have louder motors than others, but most desks provide a decibel rating, so you know what to expect.
* **Accessories**: Some desks offer extras like keyboard trays and cable management, while other desks may skip the accessories altogether.
* **Warranty**: Many desks offer a warranty, but the length can vary considerably.

## What is a standing desk?

A standing desk has many names. It's also known as a stand-up desk, height-adjustable desk, and sit-stand desk. Whatever you call it, a standing desk is one that allows its user to stand rather than sit when the desk is in use. Many of these desks are adjustable to allow users of all shapes and sizes to find a customized and comfortable fit for use. 

## How often should you stand up from your desk?

It's recommended to stand up from your desk once every hour if you have a regular sitting desk. If you have a standing desk, it's recommended to stand for four-six hours of your eight-hour workday.

## How much does a standing desk cost?

The cost of a standing desk ranges from less than $100 to more than $1,000, depending on the features you prefer. Our picks for the best standing desks range in price from less than $40 to around $750, combining affordability with convenience and reliability. 

## What are the benefits of a standing desk?

According to Healthline, standing can [lower your risk](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/7-benefits-of-a-standing-desk#TOC%5FTITLE%5FHDR%5F6) of heart disease and obesity and improve back pain. It can even reduce blood sugar levels.
