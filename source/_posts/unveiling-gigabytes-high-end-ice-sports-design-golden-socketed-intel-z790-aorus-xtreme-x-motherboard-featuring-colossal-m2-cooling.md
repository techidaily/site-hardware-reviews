## Maxsun Unveils Intel and AMD's Latest Gear: An Extensive Selection of 31 High-Performance Chipsets - Meet the Future

MaxSun, one the lesser-known motherboard manufacturers (at least in the U.S.), published an entire list of new motherboard names to the Eurasian Economic Union, including a plethora of board models sporting Intel's upcoming[800-series chipset nomenclature](https://tools.techidaily.com) — there are also some B850 and B840, though it's not entirely clear if those are both for AMD or not. (Spotted by[harukaze5719 on X](https://x.com/harukaze5719/status/1795781651248877963) ) These new model names are inevitably destined for MaxSun's upcoming[LGA1851](https://tools.techidaily.com) motherboards supporting[Arrow Lake-S](https://tools.techidaily.com) processors, as well as new AMD 800-series boards for[Zen 5 processors](https://tools.techidaily.com) .  
  
 Model names published to the EEU are not guaranteed to be used in production models, so take this information with some salt. Nevertheless, there's a high chance that some or even all of the model names seen in MaxSun's EEU listing will be used in real motherboard SKUs.

 MaxSun published a total of 31 800-series motherboard model names to the EEU, consisting of seven Z890 motherboard model names, a whopping thirteen B860 model names, four B850 model names, and a single B840 model name. There were five H810 model names, too.  
  
 Based on the names themselves, we can get a pretty good idea of each motherboard's capabilities. Out of the seven Z890 motherboard models, three appear to be flagship ATX models featuring MaxSun's iCraft nomenclature: the Vertex, Arctic, and Pacific. The last Z890 board on the list is the iCraft Z890 ITX, which is a Mini-ITX variant aimed at small form factor builds. An apparent mid-range Z890-A Terminator was also unveiled, as well as two lower-end Micro-ATX Z890 boards in the form of the ESport Z890M WiFi and the Challenger Z890M WiFi.  
  
 Most of the B860 boards appear to be Micro-ATX variants with only two being ATX boards, and two more being Mini-ITX. There's a wide range of model names in MaxSun's B860 lineup, including a single iCraft flagship model, three ESport versions, four Terminator models, five Challenger models, and a single Milestone variant. The rest of the lineup consists of mid-range/entry-level boards in Micro-ATX and Mini-ITX flavors.  
  
 Where things get interesting / confusing is in MaxSun's B850 and B840 chipset boards. The B850 will likely be the mainstream version for AMD's Zen 5 Ryzen 9000 CPUs for socket AM5, but B840... that one could be either AMD or Intel. Either way, that's a new tweak to the existing lineups — Intel currently has Z790, B760, and H770 chipsets for 14th Gen Raptor Lake (Refresh) CPUs. AMD has X670E, X670, B650E, B650, and A620 chipsets for Zen 4 socket AM5 CPUs. So where does B840 land? We're not sure, but one of the two brands will apparently be adding another chipset (at least).  
  
 Or it's possible (though unlikely) that all of these are Intel motherboards and it will expand it's chipset offerings with two additional B-class variants. Stranger things have happened. It's almost like nobody took the time to say, "Hey, having the same 800-series for our chipsets as our competitor is going to cause confusion." Why didn't AMD just go with Ryzen 8000-series CPUs and 7000-series? The world may never know.  
  
 Again, take this information with a grain of salt. For all we know, some of MaxSun's motherboard names might never be used for a shipping product, and that goes for the new chipset model names, too. We'll have to wait for an official Intel announcement to confirm its full 800-series chipset lineup, and likewise for AMD and its overlapping 800-series chipsets.
