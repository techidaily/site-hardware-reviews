## Top-Ranking Antivirus Programs : Comprehensive Review

We rely on our computers and mobile devices to help manage and control our professional and personal lives. No matter what you use your device for, your [smartphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-phone/), [tablets](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-tablet/), and [laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop/) contain personal, sensitive information that must be protected.

Antivirus software and programs are essential to protecting the details of our personal and professional lives. Device manufacturers' built-in and default antivirus protections are much improved compared to a decade ago -- but when you consider the modern-day threats we face, ranging from phishing to ransomware, you can never have enough protection.

With the right protection, you will be alerted when you visit suspicious websites, try to download or execute potentially malicious software, or malware otherwise finds its way on your system. You can also perform regular scans to remove threats from your system without too much fuss.

### Best antivirus overall

Our overall pick for the best antivirus is Bitdefender Total Security. This software is designed to protect your personal data, such as passwords or financial details. It will handle even advanced security threats and stop them from wreaking havoc on your device. 

Bitdefender is a well-known and trusted brand in the antivirus space. The antivirus solution isn't too top-heavy and won't hog your CPU, and it is available for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

Beyond detecting and blocking malware, rootkits, and ransomware, the software also prevents invasive third-party data tracking and unauthorized access to your microphone or webcam. As a bonus, subscribers can use the built-in [VPN](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/) to secure their online traffic, although this is limited to 200MB a day per device.

**Also: [The best password managers: Expert tested in 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-password-manager/)**

Bitdefender's plans are currently on sale, including the Total Security plan for $60 for a year of protection (saving you $40). The cheapest plan on offer is $35 per year. A free, limited antivirus solution is also available.

## Norton Antivirus Plus

### Best affordable antivirus

Norton Antivirus Plus is a very affordable option if you only need to protect one device. Antivirus Plus is Norton's basic antivirus solution and includes threat protection and monitoring, a firewall, and a free password manager -- alongside 2GB of cloud backup storage. 

If you want support for additional devices, dark web monitoring, a VPN, or parental controls, you will need to opt for Norton 360 Standard, Norton 360 Standard Deluxe, or Norton 360 with LifeLock Select. Customers note Norton's strong security scores, although some are less than impressed with the price jumps after promotional periods.

At the time of writing, the company is offering 50% off its Plus plan, which means you will only pay $30 for your first year of protection (protection for one device). You can also take advantage of a 57% discount on Standard plans ($40 per year) that will protect up to three devices.

### Best antivirus for extra features

McAfee Total Protection fits the bill when you want to purchase antivirus protection for multiple devices.

It offers protection for Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and Chromebooks. There is also a [free password manager](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-free-password-manager/), VPN, and Dark Web monitoring service included so you can keep your credentials safe -- and be made aware of any information leaks online that could compromise your identity or accounts.

Special alerts inform you of threats so you can act immediately. Customers say McAfee protection is solid and worth paying for, although software removal and pop-ups can be a nuisance. 

When you sign up, you will receive 12 months of protection. When you purchase the software directly from McAfee, you have options, including an Essential package protecting up to five devices for $40 per year or individual advanced plans.

### Best antivirus for use with a VPN

Surfshark is most often associated with virtual private networks (VPNs), but if you are looking for a lightweight AV bolt-on for this type of privacy tool, the Surfshark One package might be for you. 

A VPN provides an encrypted tunnel to mask your IP address and online activities. Surfshark consistently places as one of our [top VPNs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-vpn/), especially considering how affordable it is, and the firm also provides a basic antivirus within its mid- and top-tier packages. The AV runs quietly in the background and performs real-time scans to keep you safe from online threats.

Surfshark offers a range of plans to suit your needs and budget. Subscriptions start at $2.69 per month on a two-year plan, with three months of free access included. Annual plans begin at $3.39 per month. Customers like Surfshark as a solid VPN that demonstrates good value for money. 

If you would also like a data removal service from company databases and people search sites, you could also opt for Surfshark One+, which also includes a VPN and antivirus software. Plans start at $4.29 per month.

## Factors to consider when choosing antivirus software

When selecting an antivirus, you should consider:

* **Device support**: Many antivirus solutions support a variety of devices. Consider whether you want to protect your PC or mobile device, for example -- and check that plans will cover more than one machine.
* **Protection**: Research the protection on offer, including whether the software can protect you against threats such as ransomware, trojans, and spyware.
* **Price**: There are free, lightweight options that can handle day-to-day protection, but they are unlikely to offer additional support. If you opt for a paid plan, choose one suitable for your budget and be aware of any price hikes following promotional first years.
* **Additional features**: You may want a solution that provides additional advanced features such as a bundled VPN, a dark web scanner, a data breach notification service, or insurance.
* **Resource use**: Resource use varies across antivirus products, so you should check whether your machine will struggle with the extra workload. Apps tend to be optimized for modern mobile devices, but some older PCs may not work well with every antivirus option.

## How did we choose these antivirus software and apps?

There are numerous factors we consider when recommending the best antivirus software solutions, including:

* **Features**: There are many threats out there, from malware to viruses, so we look for the best antivirus protection and features available to protect your online activity, whether you are using your PC or smartphone. Features may include email attachment checks, dark web data breach alert services, VPNs, and identity data monitoring.
* **Real-time scanning**: We like to see real-time scans as a feature of modern antivirus software as we consider this imperative to modern security. This feature ensures you are warned when threats emerge.
* **Performance**: Features mean nothing if the antivirus app or software does not have the power or performance to back it up. It is important to look for antivirus software and apps that not only attack existing threats, but prevent you from facing new ones, too.
* **Accessibility**: Antivirus software has been available for quite some time, and there are now plenty of mobile antivirus apps, too. Consider how you would best like to access your antivirus program and what mobile requirements there may be.
* **Price**: The best antivirus programs do not charge the highest fees, with several programs offering free versions, but with limited features. Consider your budget when you are trying to find the best antivirus protection.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## What types of security threats are there?

Viruses are not the only thing that antivirus programs protect against. There are also worms, which attack your device and attempt to propagate across networks, and trojans that appear to be safe programs but are anything but -- as they will lurk on your device and attempt to steal your account and financial information. 

You often find viruses, worms, and trojans hidden within seemingly legitimate software, or if you are downloading pirated content, you are also putting yourself at risk of accidentally executing malware on your machine.

Ransomware, too, is a serious threat to consumers and businesses today. Modern antivirus programs are often able to stop it in its tracks before it encrypts your machine and demands a ransom payment in return for a decryption key.

Spyware, coming in forms including software executables and mobile apps, can severely impact your privacy. Spyware will monitor your activities and collect your data, and in cases of stalkerware, may also log your phone calls, text messages, social media activity, and GPS location.

Antivirus apps and programs also protect against adware that can tap into your web history and flood you with pesky and potentially dangerous ads or notifications. Also known as nuisanceware, while not usually dangerous, nuisanceware can slow down your device, drain power, and make it close to impossible to browse the internet normally.

You should keep in mind that many variants of malware today are not limited to attacks against PCs -- malicious software can also be found in seemingly benign mobile apps. 

## What is better, Norton or McAfee?

Norton and McAfee are both reputable, well-established antivirus vendors that offer great product lines. Generally speaking, McAfee is a better all-rounder for beginners, whereas Norton often earns better protection scores and ratings.

## What is the main drawback of antivirus software?

One of the main drawbacks of antivirus software and apps is the computing resources they require. You may find that some antivirus software could become a drain on your resources and slow down your system -- this is especially apparent when real-time threat scanners (an important aspect of protection) are in use. That said, vendors have vastly improved resource requirements and this is less of an issue compared to a decade ago.

## What about Kaspersky for the best antivirus?

Kaspersky Anti-Virus has long been considered an excellent antivirus program, but in 2024, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) branded Kaspersky [a national security risk](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-us-bans-kaspersky-products-citing-security-risks-what-this-means-for-you/) and the Commerce Department [banned](https://apnews.com/article/kaspersky-russia-cyber-security-ban-28f087b4395129e2f09bdb68eb13e2b1) the use of its software in the US. Kaspersky has denied these claims but intends to "[gradually wind down](https://apnews.com/article/cybercrime-kaspersky-ban-russia-6171421f4efe18f0c45528fbcb581ce9)" its operations in the country.

## How much is the best antivirus?

Many of the best antivirus programs and apps offer a free version that you can choose to protect your devices. While they may be limited in their features, you often have the option to upgrade to a $30 to $40 annual plan for more benefits. Paid plans may cover more devices, for example, or include additional features such as email scanning, dark web monitoring, and password management.

## Are there any alternative antivirus software and apps worth considering?

When you are looking for a free antivirus program, you have a huge market to consider -- and not every solution can make it to our recommendations list. If none of the options above appeal to you, we also found these options in our search for the best antivirus apps and software:
