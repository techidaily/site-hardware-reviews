## What is the difference between a Chromebook and a regular laptop?

The main difference between the two is what kind of operating system it runs. A Chromebook uses the ChromeOS, developed by Google, while most other laptops run either Windows or MacOS, though there are some models that are capable of running Linux. 

Chromebooks are also capable of running Windows if you're willing to do a little work yourself, but they're really at their best when left running ChromeOS.

You should keep in mind that the ChromeOS app ecosystem, by design, is limited. Therefore, if you need to run specific software on your new Chromebook, you should check that it is compatible first.

## Can you use a Chromebook for gaming?

Yes, but they can only really handle more advanced gaming titles via cloud-based services like GeForce Now or Xbox Cloud Gaming. Locally installed PC games aren't compatible with ChromeOS and the hardware included in the vast majority of Chromebooks wouldn't be able to handle them even if they were. You can, however, play many Android-based games on Chromebook models that support Google Play.

If you're looking for an affordable gaming laptop, you can check out our list of the [best cheap gaming laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-budget-gaming-laptop/) available.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Are there any drawbacks when using a Chromebook?

The biggest disadvantage of Chromebooks compared to other kinds of laptops is their low RAM and storage capacities. Most cap out at maybe 16GB of RAM (which is soldered in place so you can't upgrade it yourself) and at 128GB of storage. Though many Chromebooks have permanently installed 32 or 64GB eMMC storage cards, it is possible to find models equipped with a 128GB SSD; but since their processors aren't very powerful either, 128GB is about all they can support for storage, so you can't really upgrade the hard drive yourself either.

However, if you're looking for a laptop your kids can use for schoolwork or just something to be able to watch Netflix and browse the web on, they're a perfectly suitable option.
