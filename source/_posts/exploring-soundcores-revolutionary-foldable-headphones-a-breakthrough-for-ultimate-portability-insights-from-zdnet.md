## Exploring Soundcore's Revolutionary Foldable Headphones: A Breakthrough for Ultimate Portability - Insights From ZDNet

Audio brand Soundcore just released a direct follow-up to its fantastic [Space One headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/all-aboard-the-space-one-headphones-quality-features-for-a-down-to-earth-price/), the aptly named Space One Pro, and the upgrades are impressive.

The ear cups on the older headphones possess a unique structure for blocking outside noise. On the Pro version, the company expanded this design to consist of four stages working together to enhance active noise canceling (ANC). First, exterior microphones detect sound coming from the outside. The cup covers then act as barriers, preventing noise from coming in.

A chip inside the Space One Pro takes the mic input and actively cancels out disturbances in real time. The final stage sees the triple-composite drivers block out the last bit of noise. Soundcore says these speakers were specially made "for perfect audio balance" so users can enjoy "distortion-free sound." 

This output can be tweaked in two different ways. The HearID 2.0 test can create a sound profile tailored to your specifications. If you want further customization options, the headphones support multiple equalizer settings. Both of these tools can be found on the official Soundcore app.

The company also updated the headphones' design. It's just as ergonomic as before; however, the Pro model has a "FlexiCurve Structure," reducing the device's size by about 50% compared to the older model. What's more, the headband is now collapsible for easier carrying. Soundcore claims that, when folded up, the Space One Pro is about the size of a donut.

The headphone battery has a maximum runtime of 60 hours with ANC turned off. If ANC is active, battery life drops down to 40 hours. Additionally, a quick five-minute charge gives you eight hours of runtime. Other notable features include four microphones and an AI algorithm enabling crystal-clear phone calls, multipoint capabilities, plus support for Google Fast Pair.
