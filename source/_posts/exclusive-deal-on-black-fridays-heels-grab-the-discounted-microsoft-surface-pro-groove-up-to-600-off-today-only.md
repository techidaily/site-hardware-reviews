The [Microsoft Surface Pro 8](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/Surface-Pro-8/8qwcrtq8v8xg?crosssellid=&selectedColor=86888a) is a thin, lightweight hybrid device suitable for work and study. Available in a variety of different finishes and specifications, the 13" touchscreen tablet is designed for productivity -- although you may have to invest in additional accessories such as a keyboard and stylus, depending on how you want to utilize the hybrid machine. 

The lowest price point available is $799 for a platinum model with an Intel Evo Core i5 processor, 8GB RAM, and 128GB SSD storage. However, if you want more power in your device, you can still save on a Surface Pro 8 equipped with an Intel Evo Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and 1TB SSD storage -- normally priced at [$2,199, but now available for $1,899](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/Surface-Pro-8/8qwcrtq8v8xg?crosssellid=&selectedColor=86888a&ranMID=24542&ranEAID=IokOf8qagZo&ranSiteID=IokOf8qagZo-B8WOUfFT3AkbKuRP5V7sZg&epi=IokOf8qagZo-B8WOUfFT3AkbKuRP5V7sZg&irgwc=1&OCID=AID2200057%5Faff%5F7593%5F1243925&tduid=%28ir%5F%5Frnj6nxuqhgkfbk2ptnk2gyq6jn2xcxb9cey3r6on00%29%287593%29%281243925%29%28IokOf8qagZo-B8WOUfFT3AkbKuRP5V7sZg%29%28%29&irclickid=%5Frnj6nxuqhgkfbk2ptnk2gyq6jn2xcxb9cey3r6on00).
