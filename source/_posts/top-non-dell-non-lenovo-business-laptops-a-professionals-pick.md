Amazon Prime Day is here again, and one of the best deals I've come across is for Lenovo's [twelfth-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-ThinkPad-Processor-Touchscreen-Performance%2Fdp%2FB0D1D5J1J1%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3714981f-3a77-4004-9f5f-505a32073051%7Cdtp&dtb=1) for just $1,520\. I went hands-on with this laptop earlier this year and praised it for its solid suite of hardware, nice display, and great battery life: perfect for remote workers who need a dependable, high-performing device.

The ThinkPad X1 Carbon series is best suited for professionals with its solid performance and portability. This model in particular has an Intel Ultra 7 165 vPro processor with 32GB of RAM, allowing for some impressive performance. You can multitask and run multiple apps without experiencing any annoying slowdown. The high amount of memory also supports fast boot-up times and internet browsing.

[Lenovo gen 12 ThinkPad X1 Carbon for $1,500 (save $988) $1,519.99 at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1D5J1J1%3FlinkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3714981f-3a77-4004-9f5f-505a32073051%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

Another defining feature of this series is the lightweight design. The 12th Gen model weighs a diminutive 2.41 pounds and measures 12.31 x 8.45 x 0.59 inches. All in all, the laptop is pretty compact with a 14-inch touchscreen. 

Lenovo makes up for the small size by giving the screen a resolution of 1,920 x 1,200 pixels, which results in a surprisingly wide display. Also, the bezels on this laptop are noticeably thinâ€”so thin that Lenovo had to place the webcam inside a lip at the bottom of the laptop.

Pro users will appreciate the full HD webcam, dual microphones, and stereo speaker array, allowing good video conferencing capabilities. Of course, I have to mention the keyboard, which is particularly comfortable. 

Each key is covered in a matte-like material that is smooth to the touch. It may seem strange that I praise the keyboard, but as someone who writes for hours nonstop, having a design that alleviates stress means a lot. 

This laptop isn't solely for business professionals, though. It's well-rounded enough for various use cases, but it doesn't have any flashy features that a MacBook or an Asus gaming laptop has. It's a simple, easy-to-use machine with the strength to handle tough workloads.

Right now is the best time to buy the [Lenovo Gen 12 ThinkPad X1 Carbon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-ThinkPad-Processor-Touchscreen-Performance%2Fdp%2FB0D1D5J1J1%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3714981f-3a77-4004-9f5f-505a32073051%7Cdtp&dtb=1) since it's currently on sale at Amazon for $1,520 -- nearly $1,000 off the original price. I should also mention that there is a variant of the laptop with a 2.8K OLED display, which is the model [I tested back in February](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-thinkpad-i-recommend-for-hybrid-workers-is-not-lenovos-newest-model/). The [OLED version](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-ThinkPad-Processor-Touchscreen-Performance%2Fdp%2FB0D5SNKGZ4%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C3714981f-3a77-4004-9f5f-505a32073051%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is much more expensive, but I recommend it as an alternative if you can afford it.

## When will this deal expire?

At the time of this writing, it is the second day of Amazon's October Prime Day event, which will end at 11:59 p.m. EST. We don't know exactly when this deal on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon will end. Presumably, it'll be gone by the end of today although it's possible the deal will linger around a few days after the event ends later tonight, but nothing is guaranteed.
