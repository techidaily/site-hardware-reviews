## Enhance Your Eye Comfort on Android Devices with These Simple Brightness Adjustments!

Screen brightness is something you probably don't think about a lot---until it's annoying. Sometimes [looking at your phone](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-superior-mac-hd-recorders-with-in-built-sound-capture/) at the lowest brightness still seems too bright. For those situations, Android has "Extra Dim."

[Introduced in Android 12](https://extra-information.techidaily.com/audiophiles-guide-to-speed-adjustment-apps-for-2024/), "Extra Dim" does exactly what the name implies. It dims the display beyond what regular brightness controls can do. "Extra Dim" can be accessed from the Quick Toggles on Android 12+ devices and there are a few additional options to go along with it.

 The screenshots below are from a Google Pixel phone. "Extra Dim" is also available on Samsung Galaxy phones through the same steps, but it will look different.

 First, we'll need to move the "Extra Dim" tile into the Quick Settings. Swipe down twice from the top of your Android device's screen and tap the pencil icon to edit the tile layout.

 The tiles at the top section are in the Quick Settings area. Scroll down to the bottom section and find the "Extra Dim" tile. Tap and hold and then drag the tile to the top area. Lift your finger to drop the tile.

 Tap the back arrow in the top-left corner when you're done.

 Now tap and hold the "Extra Dim" tile to go to its settings.

 Toggle it on if it's not already, then you can adjust how dim you want it to go with the "Intensity" slider.

 Lastly, you can decide if you want it to stay on after you restart the device. The "Extra Dim Shortcut" option will put a floating button on the side of the screen at all times.

 That's all there is to it. Whenever you feel like the screen isn't getting quite dim enough, swipe open the Quick Settings and toggle on "Extra Dim." This is one of those little features that can make your Android experience just a bit nicer.
