Jerome Thomas / How-To Geek

 While I regularly use the entire suite of Apple products supported by wireless chargers—iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch—the truth is that 3-in-1 chargers are typically overkill as my watch is always on my wrist unless I’m sleeping. Thus, the only charger I truly need to be traditionally 3-in-1 is [the one on my nightstand](https://ios-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-make-the-most-of-your-apple-iphone-se-lock-screen-with-notifications-by-drfone-ios/). A dedicated Apple Watch charging pad is otherwise wasted on me.

 However, this doesn’t mean that an extra charging slot wouldn’t be useful to charge devices like large-format headphones or gaming handhelds [(such as my Playdate)](https://www.howtogeek.com/i-love-my-switch-but-i-prefer-this-handheld-for-quick-gaming-sessions/). This is where Belkin’s latest iteration of their BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 line comes in clutch by offering an extra 5W USB-C outlet. This is situated along the right side of the charging pad and is the same wattage as a typical Apple Watch charging pad, allowing me to still charge my watch when necessary while swapping it out for other devices in the interim.

 The dedicated charging pads for the iPhone and AirPods also function as expected. The iPhone pad—which uses the [Qi2 industry standard](https://youtube-zero.techidaily.com/ed-fake-following-fiasco-avoiding-illusory-supporters-in-social-media-space/) for fast charging—boasts a powerful magnet that will keep your phone firmly in place, and also has a soft texture that won’t threaten to scratch the back of your phone. Your AirPods are also given the treatment of sitting atop a slightly concave pad to help with air flow, though they still got warm a few times throughout my testing. There’s an LED light to indicate the AirPods are charging. These are all standard features but executed at a high quality.

##  Built Like a Rock, For Better and Worse

![Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Magnetic Wireless Charging Pad with Qi2 with iPhone and AirPods from above](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2024/07/53736573613_37a0b0319d_o.jpg)

 There’s a lot to like about the design of this charger, but it’s also the aspect that holds it back from greatness.

 First, the good. This is a sturdy pad with a sleek pill-shaped exterior that makes it perfect for slipping into your backpack. It utilizes two strong non-slip pads to prevent itself from moving around many surfaces.

 There’s a catch, however: this charging pad is both heavy and dense, weighing roughly one pound. It adds noticeable weight to your backpack, more than some portable 3-in-1 chargers. It also takes up quite a bit of desk real estate. This footprint is larger than [Belkin’s wireless charging stand](https://techtrends.techidaily.com/ultimate-guide-resolving-facetimes-dark-display-issues/) from this same family of devices, especially when a phone is mounted and the USB-C port is in use. Granted, if you’re looking for a wireless charger made for desk use, charging pads are likely not the right category for you.

 Ultimately, the portability of its form-factor is undermined by its weight. I was able to overlook the bulk it added to my backpack because I valued the functionality of the USB-C port, but those who travel light may find this product too cumbersome. I wouldn’t consider it a deal-breaker, but it’s worth considering.

##  Should You Buy a Belkin BoostCharge Pro Charger 2-in-1 with Qi2?

 If you need to charge other devices alongside your iPhone and AirPods, the [Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Charging Pad with Qi2](https://belkin.evyy.net/c/156932/2005571/3736?subId1=htgboostchargeproreview&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2F2-in-1-magnetic-wireless-charging-pad-with-qi2-15w%2FP-WIZ021.html) is an easy recommendation. The value added by the extra USB-C port makes it easy to recommend this over [the previous MagSafe iteration](https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-capturing-your-browsing-journey-top-2023-web-recorder-software/) ($79.99). This feature makes it a cheaper and more versatile alternative to 3-in-1 chargers. Just keep in mind the extra heft this charging pad will add to your bag.
