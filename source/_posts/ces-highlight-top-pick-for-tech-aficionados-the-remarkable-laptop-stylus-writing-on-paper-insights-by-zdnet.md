## CES Highlight: Top Pick for Tech Aficionados - The Remarkable Laptop Stylus Writing on Paper | Insights

MSI

CES is done and dusted, and I'd highly recommend checking out the [best innovations from this year's show](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-of-ces-2023-innovations-that-will-shape-the-future/), but please spare a minute or two for this magical stylus that gaming PC maker MSI secretly demoed while I was there. It's called the [MSI Pen 2](https://us.msi.com/Laptop-Accessory/MSI-PEN2-1P16), a graphite-tipped stylus that's bundled with the company's latest [Creator Z17 HX Studio and CreatorPro Z17 HX](https://www.msi.com/Content-Creation/Creator-Z17-HX-Studio-A13VX) Studio laptops. You won't find it anywhere else.

On a base level, the unibody stylus supports Microsoft's MPP 2.6 haptic feedback for a tactile writing experience, 4,096 pressure levels, and should last you up to 32 hours per charge. Those features are nothing new to productivity-centric styluses, but this next one surely is.

The 14.5g Pen 2, with its graphite tip, can be used to write on both the MSI laptop display _and_ a regular notepad. I've dropped a demo below if you're in just as much disbelief as I was at first.

How this wizardry is achieved remains a secret. An MSI representative only shared with me that they've balanced the hardness of the pen tip so that it's sharp enough to register physical imprints while being soft enough to not scratch the display.

As for where and when you can buy the MSI Pen 2, the stylus will only be available as a companion accessory to the company's upcoming content creation laptops, the Creator Z17 HX Studio and CreatorPro Z17 HX Studio, which are slated to arrive in February.
