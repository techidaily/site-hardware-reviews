Beyerdynamic is well-known in the industry for making headphones that convey a neutral sound; nothing overly produced or extreme. The audio from their products is typically clean and accurate, and you can be certain that you're hearing sound the way the artist intended; without pushing toward trends such as too-heavy bass or disappearing mids. 

The [DT 770 Pro X headphones](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeyerdynamic-770-Pro-Ear-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB0CQPJD8FK%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C902f3b32-6f57-4447-b65b-06a9d4c8a1e0%7Cdtp&dtb=1) are labeled for "professional use" with good reason. Their sound is completely neutral -- that, my friends, is a very good thing.

**Also: [The best earbuds I've ever listened to are not by Bose or Sony (and they're on sale)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-earbuds-ive-ever-listened-to-are-not-by-bose-or-sony-and-theyre-on-sale/)** 

In today's market of products with overly produced sound, it's refreshing to put headphones over your ears and hear such accurate production. I would go so far as to say these headphones would feel right at home in a recording studio, where it's an absolute must to hear the music exactly as it was recorded. The DT 770 Pro X headphones have sonic accuracy in spades.

Because these are wired headphones (no Bluetooth), I could plug them into my amp and listen to the aural bliss that is Rush's 40th-anniversary "Moving Pictures" on vinyl, and it was glorious from start to finish. Even though I do prefer to hear vinyl through my KEF speakers/SVC sub, the Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro X headphones presented this album with such clarity that it was almost like hearing the album for the first time (which is crazy, given how many times I've listened to it over the decades). 

Every note beat, and phrase carried such dimension that I could close my eyes and imagine I was right there, at [Le Studio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le%5FStudio), watching Geddy, Alex, and Neil record one of the greatest rock albums ever.

**Also: [I replaced my expensive Klipsch soundbar with this JBL, and it surprised me in the best way](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/i-replaced-my-expensive-klipsch-soundbar-with-this-jbl-and-it-surprised-me-in-the-best-way/)**

One very challenging track off of this album for headphones is "YYZ," but the Beyerdynamics handled it perfectly. I'd go so far as to say this is the clearest I've ever heard the song on any pair of headphones I've ever used. The sound of "YYZ" was so good that I'm afraid the Beyerdynamics have ruined every pair of headphones I own, and I won't be able to listen to it with any other device, lest I long for the sonic clarity of the DT 770 Pro X.

They're that good.

Without interruption, I listened to the entire "Moving Pictures" from start to finish because I couldn't pull my ears away. After that, I thought I'd give a listen to what I believe is one of the finest-mastered albums of my lifetime (remember "Q Sound"?), Queen's "Innuendo." Words cannot describe how good this album sounded from a pair of $199 headphones. From the first moment Freddie Mercury counted the song in, I knew this would be special.

**Also: [These earbuds sound way too good for their price point. And that's not even their best feature](https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-earbuds-sound-way-too-good-for-their-price-point-and-thats-not-even-their-best-feature/)**

Then the magic of Queen happened, and it was glorious. A pair of reference headphones to hear this album through should be on every music lover's bucket list. 

## ZDNET's buying advice

OK, if you're looking for Bluetooth headphones that deliver thunderous bass over all other frequencies, these are not the headphones you want. If you like the idea of hearing your music exactly as it was meant to be heard by the artists, the [Beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro X headphones](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBeyerdynamic-770-Pro-Ear-Headphones%2Fdp%2FB0CQPJD8FK%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C902f3b32-6f57-4447-b65b-06a9d4c8a1e0%7Cdtp&dtb=1) should be on your list. At $200, you won't find a better pair of over-ear headphones capable of delivering accuracy on this level. Straight up. 

There is no app for these headphones, no bells, no whistles; just honest, clear, and dynamic sound. If that sounds like Nirvana to you, then run (don't walk) to your favorite online retailer and purchase a pair. You won't regret it.
