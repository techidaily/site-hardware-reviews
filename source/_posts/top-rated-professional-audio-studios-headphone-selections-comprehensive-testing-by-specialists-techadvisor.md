### Audio-Technica ATH-M20x

#### Best budget studio headphones

The Audio-Technica ATH-M20x headphones also comes highly recommended as the best budget studio headphones when you do not want to spend a lot.

"The M20x is Audio Technica's cheapest option," Mak says, introducing the set. "They are quite neutral sounding with some high-frequency boosting. For mixing on a budget in a space where you're unable to have monitor speakers, the M20x is a great option."

They are also fantastic as an entry-level set. The over-ear wired headphones come with a closed back, and the lightweight fit is complimented by carefully-padded cushions for extended wear. Maxing out at 96 decibels, the 40mm drivers are sensitive to lower frequencies for studio tracking and mixing. Built-in sound isolation is incorporated with what Audio-Technica promises is minimal bleed. 

The Audio-Technica ATH-M20x also come with a carry pouch, making them a convenient option for people who travel frequently. However, "You cannot detach their cord, and they're less comfortable than their bigger siblings," Mak warns.

If you are looking for a great buy, the Sony MDR-7506 Studio Headphones pack phenomenal value. Emilio Guarino, a classically trained bass player and current Music Producer and Engineer at [Glitch Magic](http://glitchmagic.com), shares his thoughts. "The Sony MDR, in particular, is a very trusted staple at this point and has been around since the early 90s, so it's a proven design."

## How did I choose these best studio headphones?

When searching for the best studio headphones, I used several factors to formulate my list that may also help with your search.

* **Type of headphones:** There are two main types of headphones: open-back and closed-back. The vast majority of headphones are closed-back, meaning their ear cups isolate sound in both directions. Open-back headphones let air pass through their ear cups, preventing low frequencies from building up inside the headphones, theoretically creating a flatter, more natural sound.
* **Purpose:** Consider how you plan to use your headphones. Different headphones may work better for specific purposes. For example, experts recommend open-back headphones for mixing, while closed-back headphones shine when used for producing and recording music. Durability is also an important factor should you travel a lot or live an otherwise active life.
* **Fit:** There are both on-ear and over-ear studio headphones, depending on the fit you prefer. On-ear headphones simply fit over your ear, while over-ear studio headphones envelop your whole ear for a tighter fit. While over-ear studio headphones provide better noise isolation, on-ear headphones are generally more compact, making for easier storage.
* **Price:** The cost of studio headphones can range from less than a hundred dollars to more than one thousand. I looked at headphones that suit a variety of budgets, helping to ensure that there is something for everyone.

I also spoke to experts in the music and audio industries who recommend/have used these studio headphones in a professional setting. 

## Why do I need studio headphones?

Mak said studio headphones are best for professionals working with sound or music. 

"In a professional situation, studio headphones are most common for monitoring when a musician listens to sound while they record," explains Mak. "This isolates the sounds being recorded from what the user is listening to, creating cleaner recordings."

He adds that studio headphones can be used for mixing recorded audio and balancing multiple sound sources, but warns, "they generally sound less accurate than monitor speakers, the professional standard."

If you are a musician that mixes or records music, a pair of the best studio headphones can completely transform your process and lead to a better finished product when it's all said and done.

## What's the difference between studio headphones and normal headphones?

Guarino is familiar with studio headphones as an experienced musician and explains the difference between regular headphones and studio ones. 

"The biggest single difference between 'studio' headphones and consumer-focused headphones is how they color the sound. Generally in the studio, we want a neutral representation of what we're hearing."

Of regular headphones, Guarino says, "They're designed to enhance the listening experience of a finished product, not for putting the product together."

While standard headphones are designed to provide easy listening, studio headphones provide extra features like enhanced noise isolation to better serve professionals and creatives.

## How much do studio headphones cost?

The best studio headphones truly run the gamut in cost. You can expect to pay anywhere from about $50 to $3,000, depending on the pair you choose. Before you buy, consider your level of experience and whether an advanced pair of studio headphones is necessary for your purposes. 

## Are there alternative best studio headphones worth considering?

There are plenty of other studio headphones available in a wide variety of brands, price points, and features. While searching for the best studio headphones, I also found these options that may be worth a second look.
