## Dell XPS 16 (2024)

### Best Windows laptop overall

The Dell XPS 16 is arguably the most well-rounded laptop that you can buy right now. As the "Goldilocks" of Dell's XPS line, it sports all of the best features from other models while introducing several improvements.

Design-wise, the XPS 16 features a zero-lattice keyboard and seamless glass trackpad making for a sleek, stylish-looking device. The display is also gorgeous with a 16-inch, 4K OLED touchscreen surrounded by ultra-thin bezels, giving the illusion that it's bigger than it actually is. 

**Review: [Dell XPS 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dell-xps-16-2024-review/)**

The XPS line of laptops is highly configurable, but my review unit came with the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card, giving it the ability to easily handle tough workloads like video editing or graphical rendering. 

All in all, the wide range of configurations, the sleek form factor, and the gorgeous display make the Dell XPS 16 one of the most well-rounded and performant laptops on the market in 2024.

**Dell XPS 16 t** **ech specs: Operating System:** Windows 11 (Home, Pro) | **CPU:** Intel Core Ultra 7 or 9 | **GPU:** Intel Arc, Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050, 4060, 4070 | **Display:** 16" 4K OLED touchscreen | **RAM, Storage:** Up to 64GB RAM, 4TB SSD | **Camera:** 1080p at 30 fps FHD | **Battery:**  99.5Whr | **Dimensions:** 0.74 x 14.10 x 9.5 (inches) | **Weight:** 4.8 lbs.

### Best Windows laptop for Samsung users

Featuring one of the best displays on the market, Samsung's Galaxy Book 4 Edge is a well-rounded, performance-driven laptop with the powerful new Snapdragon X Elite processor that brings robust power to Windows on ARM.   
  
In our testing, we found the Galaxy Book 4's 16-inch AMOLED touchscreen to be one of its best features, with new anti-reflective glass and updated functionality from its predecessor. This, coupled with the powerful Snapdragon X Elite processor, results in a laptop that looks as good as it feels, with lightning-fast response time and a marathon battery lasting upwards of 20 hours.

**Also: [Every Copilot+ PC Microsoft just announced to take on Apple's M3 MacBooks](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-copilot-pc-microsoft-just-announced-to-take-on-apples-m3-macbooks/)**  
  
The Galaxy Book 4 Edge also has a host of features with compatible Samsung smartphones, including AI functionality with Windows Copilot, allowing voice control over your Galaxy phone from the PC. These integrations make it the standout choice for users looking for a new Snapdragon PC and already use the Samsung Galaxy ecosystem.

### Best Windows 2-in-1 convertible laptop

Convertible 2-in-1 laptops are handy because they can satisfy a variety of use cases. In my opinion, the best 2-in-1 device on the market today is the Asus Zenbook 14 Flip OLED. On specific aspects, you could argue that there are better options out there, but in terms of a complete package, you can't beat this, based on [my testing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-challenge-you-to-find-a-better-looking-laptop-for-under-1000-than-this/).

**Also:** [**Asus Zenbook 14 Flip hands-on review**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-challenge-you-to-find-a-better-looking-laptop-for-under-1000-than-this/)

The Zenbook 14 Flip OLED sports a stunning, vibrant 14-inch OLED screen outputting 2.8K resolution, covering 100% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It also has a contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1, which is notable because it allows the laptop to show off incredible detail. The image is so clear on the Zenbook 14 Flip OLED you can see the pixels on the screen, which is truly the best thing about it. All this is housed in a sturdy yet lightweight 3.31-pound aluminum frame. Under the hood, you'll find a 13th Gen Intel Core i5 processor, an Iris Xe graphics card, and 16GB of memory -- excellent hardware for good all-around performance.

**Also: [The best 2-in-1 laptops: Top flexible, hybrid, and convertible notebooks](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-2-in-1-laptop/)**

Other important features of the Zenbook 14 Flip include its 1080p IR webcam (perfect for video calls), a keyboard with a great typing feel, and a decent assortment of connections. While the laptop has a thin form factor, it still has a USB-C port, a headphone jack, and an HDMI input on top of the Thunderbolt 4\. 

The one downside is it is a bit heavy. You see this criticism over on the Amazon reviews for the Zenbook 14 -- users said they enjoy how powerful it is, although they wish it were lighter.

**ASUS Zenbook 14 Flip OLED tech specs: Operating System:** Windows 11 Home | **CPU:** 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1340P | **GPU:** Intel Iris Xe Graphics | **RAM:** 16GB | **Camera:** 1080p with IR | **Battery:** 75Wh | **Dimensions:** 311mm x 223mm x 16mm | **Weight:** 3.31lbs

Pros 
* Powerful hardware

Cons

* Rather bulky

### Best Windows laptop for business

The IdeaPad Pro 5i is a versatile device that's exceptionally well-suited for the office and has a host of productivity optimizations. It comes with an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU for rock-solid performance, handling web browsing with dozens of tabs, working with large documents, and video conferencing simultaneously. 

All this power can be thoroughly enjoyed on the IdeaPad Pro's hi-res 2K (2,048 x 1,280) OLED screen, which can display content in stunning detail. Thanks to its hardware, the screen has a speedy refresh rate of 120Hz, enabling smooth media playback and a silky-smooth visual display.

**Review: [Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-longest-lasting-laptops-ive-tested-also-has-one-of-the-best-displays/)**   
  
The IdeaPad Pro's generous heft allows for a full-sized keyboard. When paired with the rubber-like keycaps, it makes a very comfortable typing experience. I also appreciate how the arrow keys jut out from the bottom, making them easy to access. This is a laptop you won't mind typing on day after day.   
  
The battery life is great, too. The IdeaPad Pro 5i ran for about 8.5 hours straight while running my usual livestream tests without the battery saver setting on. With that active, rest assured the device will last you the whole day, and then some. 

**Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i** **t** **ech specs:** **Operating System**: Windows 11 Pro 64 | **CPU:** Intel Core Ultra 9 | **GPU:** Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 | **Display:** 16" 2K OLED Touchscreen (2048 x 1280) 120Hz | **RAM, Storage:** 32GB, 1TB | **Camera:** Integrated 1080P FHD Webcam | **Battery:** 81Wh | **Dimensions:** 14.02 x 9.88 x 0.69 (inches) | **Weight:** 4.27 lbs.

### Best budget Windows laptop

Laptops can be expensive, and there's no reason to pay for what you don't need. If you just need a laptop to cover the basics or a backup machine for travel, the best option is the Acer Aspire Go 15\. This $299 laptop has a 15-inch screen and all the hardware you need to cover web browsing, email, productivity, and media playback for a price you can't argue with.

The Aspire Go 15 has an Intel Core i3-N305, a somewhat low-end processor with just 8GB of RAM. This combination of hardware puts a cap on what this machine is capable of. However, in my testing, the laptop could mostly keep up with my internet browsing habits (lots of YouTube tabs) and work-related apps, if not some stuttering once the CPU was taxed. 

**Review: [Acer Aspire Go 15](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-299-windows-laptop-is-my-new-go-to-recommendation-for-budget-shoppers/)**

Similarly, the 15-inch screen on this laptop is not the brightest display on the market, but it's big enough for browsing the web comfortably. The keyboard and trackpad are also light, responsive, and quiet, with enough texture and springiness to make a comfortable experience. 

The selection of ports here is also just enough. You get two USB-A ports, one USB-C, an HDMI port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a Kensington lock slot. To sum it up, the Acer Aspire Go 15 is a surprisingly well-optimized 15-inch laptop for a price that won't break the bank. 

**Acer Aspire Go 15 tech specs: Operating System:** Windows 11 Home in S Mode | **CPU:** Intel Core i3 | **GPU:** Intel UHD Graphics | **Display:** 15.6" 1080p Full HD IPS, 60Hz | **RAM, Storage:** 8GB, 128GB | **Camera:** 720p HD | **Battery:** 50Wh | **Dimensions:** 14.29 x 0.74 x 9.44 (inches) | **Weight:** 3.86 lbs.

### Best Windows OLED laptop

Asus' sleek new Zenbook S 16 runs on the recently-released AMD Ryzen AI 9 chip with a 50-tops NPU to boost performance via AI. There's been a lot of hype surrounding this processor as it's supposed to be AMD's answer to Intel's AI chips and the Qualcomm Snapdragon X, and in my benchmarking it outperformed the Snapdragon when it came to graphics. 

Speaking of graphics, I adore the display. It is a 16-inch 3K (2880 x 1800 pixels) OLED touchscreen that runs at a speedy refresh rate of 120Hz. The glass appears to be covered in an anti-fingerprint coating because no matter how many times I touched it, not a single smudge was left behind. It also covers the entire DCI-P3 color gamut, allowing over a billion colors to be displayed on the screen at once. 

**Review: [Asus Zenbook S 16](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-asus-has-one-of-the-best-oled-displays-ive-seen-and-ive-tested-hundreds-of-laptops/)**

I also have to mention the physical design of the Zenbook. It's made out of "ceraluminum," a composite material made of ceramic and aluminum primarily used in aerospace design due to its strength, scratch resistance, and lightness. All of which directly apply to this laptop (particularly the latter), as the Zenbook weighs just 3.3 pounds. Not to mention, it looks premium and unique. 

I recommend the Asus Zenbook S 16 to users who want a lightweight laptop with a gorgeous OLED display and powerful AI capabilities. AMD's next-gen chipset provides solid performance, but it falls short in running as cool as other processors on the market, and its battery life is not the best, giving around 10 hours during our battery test. 

**Asus Zenbook S 16 tech specs: Operating System:** Windows 11 Pro | **CPU:** AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX 370, 5.1GHz | **GPU:** AMD Radeon 880M | **Display:** 16-inch AMOLED, up to 500 nits brightness, 120Hz refresh rate | **RAM, Storage:** Up to 32GB, Up to 1TB SSD | **Camera:** 1080p FHD | **Battery:** Up to 10 hours | **Weight:** 3.3 lbs.

## Microsoft Surface Pro 11th-Edition

### Best Windows laptop for creators

There's been a lot of hype surrounding Copilot+ PCs since they were first [announced in May of 2024](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-copilot-pc-microsoft-just-announced-to-take-on-apples-m3-macbooks/). So far, it seems much of the hype has been founded, with the [performance of these new machines](https://www.zdnet.com/article/could-windows-finally-get-arm-right-and-outperform-apple-silicon/) speaking for themselves. Microsoft's 11th-edition Surface Pro lives up to expectations. 

The Surface Pro is not a traditional laptop, but that's a good thing. Creators who work with digital content need something portable, reliable, and, most importantly, powerful: the Surface Pro nails all three of those qualifications. While it's _technically_ a tablet, the Surface Pro has an upgraded ecosystem of [accessories,](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/surfaceproaccessories) such as keyboards and pens, that make its identity a little bit less clear-cut. Its kickstand design allows you to shift from tablet to laptop mode, and the ultraportable form factor makes it easy to go wherever. 

**Review:** [**11th-Edition Microsoft Surface Pro**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-tablet-i-recommend-most-for-work-travel-is-not-an-ipad-or-thinkpad/)

The Surface Pro houses Qualcomm's new Snapdragon X Elite processor, providing impressive performance and battery life. Creators and pro users will love the gorgeous 13-inch OLED PixelSense Flow touchscreen that pumps out an image resolution of 2,880 x 1,920 pixels with a 120Hz refresh rate. And with all the software enhancers, image quality is nothing short of stunning. 

Regarding the pen, during my testing I found that its level of precision extends to illustration, accurately portraying every brush stroke and scribble. Also, the flat end of the pen is a handy button with configurable double-tap gestures. For all of these reasons, the [Surface Pro 11th edition](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-surface-pro-copilot-pc-13-snapdragon-x-plus-16gb-memory-256gb-ssd-device-only-11th-edition-platinum%2F6582846.p) is a solid computer for professional artists who want a high-performance machine and a brilliant display.

**Microsoft Surface Pro 11th-Edition tech specs: Operating System:** Windows 11 Home | **CPU:** Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (with LCD display) or Elite (with OLED) | **GPU:** Qualcomm Adreno | **Display:** 13" OLED or LCD, 120Hz | **RAM, Storage:** up to 32GB, up to 1TB | **Camera:** 1440p Quad HD ultrawide camera, 10MP Ultra HD rear-facing camera | **Battery:** 46Wh | **Dimensions:** ‎13 x 8.2 x 0.37 (inches) | **Weight:** 1.97 lbs.

## Razer Blade 17

### Best Windows gaming laptop

Not only is the Razer Blade 17 the best gaming laptop on the market, but it's also our pick for the [best 17-inch laptop](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-17-inch-laptop/). The reason is its perfect blend of power and portability. To put it lightly, this machine is stacked. Starting models come with a 12th Gen Intel Core i7-12800H, although you can upgrade it to an Intel Core i9 for better performance. 

The model listed here is from 2022, and it saw multiple improvements from the 2021 version. For starters, it can do 4K resolution gameplay better than before. The Razer Blade 17 had difficulties outputting high-resolution content so people had to lower the game settings so it ran more smoothly. Also, the cooling fans were way louder back then.

## Which Windows laptop is right for you?

The key to deciding which Windows laptop is best for you starts with asking and evaluating what you want or need it for. 

For example, if you're a mobile knowledge worker, you'll want a combination of lightweight, flexible configuration, sturdy build, connectivity, security, battery life, and design credibility. But if you're a largely deskbound graphic designer or creator who occasionally needs to visit a client with a laptop in tow, your priorities will be different.

## How we test Windows laptops

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

We use a combination of methods to test laptops here at ZDNET. First, we acquire data from benchmarking software to analyze a system's metrics under the hood, and compare those to advertised numbers. Then, we spend an extended amount of time with the laptop (usually a week or two) using it the same way a normal consumer would, in order to analyze its portability, form factor, and how well the battery _actually_ holds up, among others. For an extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive [laptop testing methodology](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-laptops/).

* **Benchmarking:** First, we run a series of tests to put the computer's hardware through the wringer in order to see what it's capable of. [Cinebench](https://www.maxon.net/en/downloads/cinebench-2024-downloads) is one of the most commonly used hardware testing suites, which tests the laptop's rendering performance on single and multiple CPU cores. [PCMark 10](https://benchmarks.ul.com/pcmark10) is another powerful program that covers a wide variety of tasks performed in the workplace, and there are many others that we use in tandem to gather as much data as we can. Some components we run tests on include:
* **Processor:** The "brain" of the laptop, and one of the most important factors that determines performance. The four biggest manufacturers that make most of the CPUs found in laptops today are Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple (in their own machines only). This is tested in benchmarking software.
* **The display:** The size of the display (measured diagonally from corner to corner) is also what dictates the laptop's overall size, and play a big role in the laptop's cost. Brightness is measured in "nits," and color spectrums are tested in benchmarking software.
* **The graphics processor (GPU):** Whether it's integrated into the CPU or a dedicated graphics card, how well the machine handles graphics is a key factor when it comes to demanding visual tasks like video editing, rendering, and of course, gaming. We test the GPU with a combination of benchmarking software, gaming, and media playback.
* **Physical form factor:** Finally, the laptop's overall appearance and physical form factor encompasses its weight, thickness, how the keyboard and trackpad feel, and whether or not it has a display that can be folded back to form a tablet. We carry the laptop around for at least a week and note how well it commutes.
* **Battery testing:** We test a unit's battery in a few ways. A handful of benchmarking programs have their own battery testing components, but we also will just let the laptop run for as long as it can under a medium load. We ensure screensavers and hibernation mode are turned off, set the display's brightness and audio at 50%, load up a livestream on YouTube in Chrome, and wait 'til the end.
* **The human element:**  As we mentioned earlier, metrics and system data is important, but numbers alone don't give you the full picture. This is where we weave in our personal experience with the device and tap into the practical use cases that consumers actually care about.

Ultimately, our goal is to break down the capabilities of each and every laptop we test into digestible terms that real people can find useful. There is a lot of noise and confusion when it comes to navigating the laptop and computer consumer market, so we hope to bring an intuitive element to the whole process by leveraging our team's decades of experience. 

## What are some factors to consider when choosing a Windows laptop?

We selected these Windows laptops after conducting thorough research and real-world testing  experts. In our evaluation, we weighed the following aspects:

* **Design:** As the name suggests, design focuses primarily on how aesthetically pleasing a laptop looks. Does it come in a good color and is the computer made of a good, sturdy material? Those are some of the questions we try to answer.
* **Performance:** Laptop hardware can vary wildly, so it's important to mention what's powering the machine. Some opt for processors you'd see in smartphones, while others go for top-of-the-line CPUs. Battery life is also taken into account.
* **Display:** Naturally, you'll want a laptop with the best possible display since you'll be staring at one for hours. But we also consider the screen size as it dictates the overall size and weight of the laptop.
* **Features:** Lastly, we consider the full suite of features a laptop has. Gaming laptops have RGB lights, whereas a work computer may skew to have a better webcam than others.

## Why should you buy a laptop and not a desktop or a tablet?

These days, a "computer" for most people is a laptop of some kind. The desktop form factor — particularly in the shape of [all-in-one (AIO) devices](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-all-in-one-computer/) — is by no means finished. Still, laptops span the range from thin, light, and ultraportable to bulky, powerful, and deskbound. 

If small screens are a problem, you can always attach an external monitor. There are also plenty of hybrid 2-in-1 devices that straddle the divide between laptops and tablets.

## Which operating system should you choose: Windows, Chrome OS, or Linux?

Every operating system has its committed supporters, but most people end up using a particular one either because of key applications run on it, it was chosen for them by their employer, or their familiarity with the OS. [Windows](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-add-a-work-or-school-account-to-windows-10-or-11/) spans the range from budget to premium, while [Chrome OS](https://www.zdnet.com/article/five-reasons-chromebooks-are-the-perfect-laptop/) is largely confined to the affordable end of the market.

All of the Windows devices listed here qualify for Windows 11\. So if you buy one with Windows 10 installed, you'll be able to upgrade to the newer version. If you don't, note that Windows 10 support ends on October 14, 2025, after which there will be no more security patches or feature updates.

## Is there a top brand for Windows laptops?

Everything listed in this guide are all the top brands for Windows laptops. If you're looking for a specific one that rises above the rest, there isn't one. Laptops by each of the major manufacturers have their pros and cons. All of them do something unique that some might like while others don't. It ultimately comes down to personal preference.

## What should a good quality laptop cost?

That's a tough question to answer because it ultimately comes down to what you, the buyer, are looking for. But we can give you an idea. Budget devices, by and large, cost less than $800\. Hardware below that range can deliver solid overall performance and, most importantly, a long battery life. $1,500 and above is where you begin to see the elite laptops, the cream of the crop. You're looking at gaming laptops, business computers like the Microsoft Surface Laptop Studio 2, and specialty machines such as the Panasonic Toughbook 55.

Between $800 and $1,500 is where you will the mid-range options. Everyday laptops that can perform well while also not completely destroying your wallet. Most options fall in this range with plenty to choose from.

## Should you stick to the usual laptop vendors or seek out lesser-known brands?

Generally speaking, the leading PC vendors have the broadest range of offerings and the best-documented track records in terms of product development and customer relations. So in the absence of certain use cases or budgets, you're usually looking at the likes of Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple, and Acer; all of which currently lead the PC market plus a handful of other well-known brands.

## Are there other products that you have tested?

We've covered just about every situation where you'd need a Windows laptop, including rugged models for field work, ultra-powerful workstations for developers, and content creation. But if you're still looking to weigh your options, here are two more Windows laptops we consider great choices.
