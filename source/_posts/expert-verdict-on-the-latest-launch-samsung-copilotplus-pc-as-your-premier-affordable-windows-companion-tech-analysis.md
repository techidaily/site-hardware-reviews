Alienware is one of the most well-respected brands of [gaming laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-budget-gaming-laptop/). These machines feature high-performing processors, cutting-edge graphics cards, and form factors designed with gamers in mind. Unfortunately, all those high-end components come with a cost.

Luckily, even after Labor Day sales, we're still seeing some sweet discounts on high-performing machines. Case in point: the [Alienware M18](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAlienware-M18-Gaming-Laptop-i9-14900HX%2Fdp%2FB0CXVSRY56%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C06cd33ae-792e-400b-bc3c-919c62078341%7Cdtp&dtb=1), a classic beast of a laptop that emulates the desktop experience with its massive 18-inch display and powerful hardware. It's currently $300 off on Amazon, bringing the price down to $1,981 for the Intel Core i7, RTX 4070 configuration. Let's take a look at what's under the hood. 

[Alienware M18 for $1,981 (Save $300) View now at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FAlienware-M18-Gaming-Laptop-i9-14900HX%2Fdp%2FB0CXVSRY56%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C06cd33ae-792e-400b-bc3c-919c62078341%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

The M18 comes with the Intel Core i7-14700HX processor, which, when paired with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 graphics card, provides a powerful hardware baseline. But it's the display that steals the show here. The 18-inch QHD screen looks smooth as silk with a 165Hz refresh rate and 16:10 display with Dolby Vision. 

With a 1TB SSD and 16GB or 32GB of RAM, performance is future-proofed for big game files. Simply put, this is a machine that will slay the requirements for high-end games, but also works well for tasks like video editing and streaming.

Other design perks to Alienware devices were made with gamers in mind, including full keypads with satisfying (never mushy) keys in a recessed design for that extra key travel. Additionally, all of those components are inevitably going to heat up during gaming sessions, but advanced cooling tech keeps things running cool.
