## Power Up with Intel's Latest Innovation: Transforming the Future of Laptops and Their Amazing Features

Intel/ZDNET

Ahead of [IFA 2024 in Berlin](https://www.ifa-berlin.com/), Intel unveiled its next-gen processor: the [Core Ultra 200V](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/power-efficient-core-ultra-200v-series-mobile.html), formerly known as Lunar Lake. This series aims to directly challenge Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite and AMD's Strix Point lines by being the new premiere choice for laptops.

For the Core Ultra 200V series, Intel is focusing on two major areas -- speed and longevity. Each of the nine models consists of four performance cores and four efficiency cores with varying amounts of RAM. For example, the Intel Core Ultra 5 processor 226V has 8GB of memory while the high-end 288V has 12GB. According to the company, these chipsets will be able to "intelligently" tweak their performance. This will be done through several features.

Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 can accelerate hardware performance "for peak loads." Dynamic Tuning optimizes energy consumption to match a laptop's power policies. Adaptive Boost Technology allows users to enhance the processor so it can "run faster than its rated frequency."

Additionally, both the integrated graphics card and neural processing unit are seeing their own upgrades. The Arc houses Intel's Xe Super Sampling and Xe Matric eXtensions engines providing "AI upscaling and ray tracing… beyond what people expect from" a lightweight laptop. The Lunar Lake NPU can now peak at 48 TOPS (trillions of operations per second).

As for the battery, Intel made unique design choices. They've implemented a feature called [OS containment](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/power-efficient-core-ultra-200v-series-mobile.html#gs.e3516f): enabling the Core Ultra 200V chipset to keep a laptop's workload "on efficiency cores (E-cores) as much as possible." When a workload is particularly demanding, it'll shift things over to the performance cores until they're no longer needed. Then the P-cores shut down to conserve energy.

It's unknown exactly what the battery life will be like on a Lunar Lake laptop. It'll depend from device to device, however, online reports give us an idea of what to expect.

After conducting the UL Procyon Office Productivity benchmark test, [Intel claims](https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/intels-core-ultra-200v-chips-aim-for-ai-pc-dominance-160029852.html) the Core Ultra 9 288V lasted about 14 hours on a single charge. [Qualcomm's Snapdragon X Elite](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fgalaxy-book4-edge%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-book4-edge-14-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-512gb-sapphire-blue-np940xma-kb1us%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) and AMD HX 370 chipsets run for about 9.5 and 10.1 hours, respectively, on the same test. 

The company goes on to state the 200V series boasts superior gaming performance by being almost 70 percent better than Qualcomm's hardware. As impressive as this may sound, keep in mind that the Lunar Lake is meant for everyday or work laptops. It'll most likely be unable to outperform the [best gaming laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-gaming-laptop/).

Intel/ZDNET

The first wave of laptops housing Intel's new chip is [launching on September 24](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24233957/intel-lunar-lake-core-ultra-200v-launch). We don't know what'll be coming out at the end of the month, however, other reports claim Dell has already announced a new version of their XPS 13 laptop sporting a Lunar Lake processor. 

We were unable to locate the refreshed computer. None of the XPS 13 models on Dell's website possess a Core Ultra 200V series processor. It's either a Meteor Lake or a Snapdragon X Elite SoC (system on a chip). Assuming the reports are true, the new unit may be available for pre-order within the coming weeks.
