At Google's annual [Made By Google event](http://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-expect-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/) in Mountain View, California, the tech giant unveiled the latest Pixel hardware, like the Pixel 9 Series, the new Pixel 9 Fold, the Pixel Watch 3, and, most importantly (for me), the Pixel Buds Pro 2\. 

**Also: [Everything announced at Made by Google 2024: Pixel 9 Pro, Fold, Gemini, Watch 3, and more](https://www.zdnet.com/article/everything-to-expect-at-made-by-google-2024-pixel-9-pro-fold-gemini-watch-3-and-more/)**

When the original Pixel Buds Pro debuted in 2022, ZDNET called [them not just good earbuds but great ones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-buds-pro-review/), even saying they were the AirPods Pro of Android devices. So, how do the newly announced Pixel Buds Pro 2, which offer a significant upgrade from the earlier earbuds and are [available for pre-order](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/9041660/type/dlg/sid/zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp/https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel%5Fbuds%5Fpro%5F2) today, hold up to the AirPods Pro 2?

##  You should buy the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 if...  

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

###  1\. You are a tried and true Android user 

Android users will benefit most from these earbuds. Certain features new to these buds, like the [Gemini Live compatibility](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-gemini-live-how-googles-real-time-chatbot-competes-with-gpt-4o/) that lets you access Google's chatbot through the buds' command or the new Find My network that offers a more precise location for your buds. The app is only available on [Android phones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-android-phone/), but iOS users can access the device-locating software via web browser. 

###  2\. You're all-in on comfort and battery life 

The Pixel Buds Pro 2 include an upgraded design that focuses on comfort and all-day wear. Unlike [the original version](https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-pixel-buds-pro-review/), the Pixel Buds Pro 2's design includes a bulb and wing tips that help to stabilize the buds in your ears as you exercise, take calls, or work in the office. 

This upgraded design means you can twist the earbuds into your ears, securing them in place. The buds also have active in-ear pressure relief to combat pressure buildup and deliver a comfortable, easy fit.

As far as battery life goes, the Buds Pro 2 offers a longer run. With ANC turned on, they offer eight hours of power, compared to only six with the AirPods Pro 2\. 

With extended battery life and enhanced comfort, Google gives you more reasons to keep the buds in your ears -- and we couldn't be happier.

###  3\. You want the newest technology 

There are many other additions to these buds to get jazzed about, such as the Tensor A1 chip for advanced audio processing, conversation detection for a more seamless pause and play experience, and Google's Silent Seal, which reportedly cancels twice as much noise.

All these new features come at a lower-than-average price of $229, compared to $250 for the [AirPods Pro 2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-airpods-pro-2-review/). It's also worth noting that the AirPods Pro 2 are two years old, while these buds were just released today. With the Pixel Buds Pro 2, you're getting up-to-date technology.

##  You should buy the AirPods Pro 2 if... 

Jason Hiner/ZDNET

###  1\. You are a ride-or-die iOS user

Non-Android users might not be interested in the latest Google hardware updates, even if the Buds Pro 2 are newer than the AirPods Pro 2\. The AirPods Pro 2 are [the best earbuds you can buy](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-earbuds/) from Apple's range of earbuds (we've said as much in our best-of lists). If you already have an [iPhone](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/), [iPad](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/), [Apple Vision Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tried-apple-vision-pro-for-a-weekend-and-here-are-my-3-biggest-takeaways/), or [MacBook](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-mac/), you can use Find My, seamless device compatibility, and more with the AirPods Pro 2\.

###  3\. You don't mind older technology 

Yes, the AirPods Pro 2 are two years old. That age means they're regularly on sale and can be heavily discounted from their original $250 price point. And if you're willing to wait a month or two, [new Apple earbuds are coming](https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-new-airpods-models-expected-this-fall-heres-everything-we-know-so-far/). If the AirPods Pro 2 aren't compelling to you right now, but you are still interested in iOS-specific earbuds, be patient and stay alert to Apple's rumored release of two new AirPods models at its September event.
