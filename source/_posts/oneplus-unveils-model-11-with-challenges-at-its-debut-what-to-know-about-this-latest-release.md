## OnePlus Unveils Model 11 with Challenges at Its Debut – What to Know About This Latest Release

Since its inception, OnePlus has always released its phones in the US, and since the OnePlus 6T, carriers like T-Mobile have sold its phones. The OnePlus 11 has been announced, and it's a big step forward --- but also a step back in terms of US support.

 The OnePlus 11 has been unveiled globally after an initial reveal in China, and it might be a contender for the [best Android phone](https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/hot-takes-highlight-twitters-trending-topics-for-2024/). For starters, it has a 6.67-inch QHD+ 120Hz AMOLED display and a Qualcomm [Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-your-essential-list-of-free-high-quality-online-meeting-software-for-2024/), as well as up to 80W charging and 16GB of RAM. We also get a 50MP rear camera setup with Hasselblad branding, ensuring you'll get a top-notch experience if you choose to buy this smartphone.

 The bad news, however, is that OnePlus has ended its year-long partnership with T-Mobile, which won't carry the OnePlus 11\. This is a setback for US support as it means that it will only be sold unlocked, something that could prove tricky for US buyers as it means support on carriers could be a hit-or-miss thing. As a reminder, OnePlus is currently operating as essentially a sub-brand of OPPO, a China-based smartphone maker that doesn't have a presence of its own in the United States.

 You'll be able to [buy the OnePlus 11](https://onepluscom.pxf.io/c/5597632/916678/12532?subId1=UUhtgUeUpU202713&subId2=ehtg&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Fus%2Foneplus-11%3Fsku%3D5011102228) starting at $699.
