Baseus Blade 100W, 20000mAh power bank.

While most power banks are aimed at users who want to keep their smartphones and tablets topped up, the [Baseus Blade 100W power bank](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F9041660%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fzd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BZP6R4MH%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C2dfc1b22-b89e-4b7e-983d-3152bf2b2ef8%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is aimed at laptop users who want to get more done before they're forced to stop because of a dead battery.

This is one of my favorite power banks. It's the one that lives in my MacBook Pro bag, ready for when I need it.

So, what is it that I like about the Baseus Blade? There are quite a few things. 

First, and as strange as this sounds, I like the shape. A lot of people don't consider the shape of their power banks, but if it's going to go into a laptop bag, I don't want a huge brick with sharp corners. The flat square design with rounded corners, texturized soft coating, and soft silicone feet is perfect for throwing into a laptop bag. 

On the front is an easy-to-read display that shows the unit's runtime, input and output power, and the time it will take for the unit to be charged or discharged.

Also, while I'm a huge fan of mega-capacity power banks, I'm less impressed by them if I have to lug them around. The 20,000mAh capacity is enough to top up a few devices and at a hair under a pound, it's not all that noticeable in a bag with a laptop.

It's also nice and simple. On the front are an on and off button and four ports -- two USB-A ports and two USB-C ports. Simple.

The USB ports can be used in single, dual, triple, or quadruple configurations. When using a single USB port, a USB-A port can output up to 30W, while a USB-C port can push out 100W.

And now that the [Baseus Blade 100W power bank](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F9041660%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fzd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0BZP6R4MH%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C2dfc1b22-b89e-4b7e-983d-3152bf2b2ef8%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is down to $80 in this year's Amazon Prime Day sales, this power bank is more of a compelling buy than ever.
