## Which cheap laptop is right for you?

The first decision you need to make is whether you want a Windows machine or a Chromebook running ChromeOS. Both operating systems have their strengths: Windows offers continuity from the desktop experience, while ChromeOS offers simplicity. Think about how you intend to use the laptop when making this choice. 

Some of these systems run Windows 10S, which is a version of Windows 10 that can only run apps from the Windows app store. This has both pros (increased security and reliability) and cons (fewer options), so bear this in mind if you plan to take this path. 

Next, prioritize what you want from the hardware. The $350 price point won't buy you everything, so you're going to have to choose which features you value most. Do you absolutely need a big display, more storage, or more RAM?

## How did we choose these cheap laptops?

While testing and researching each laptop on this list, I kept these criteria in mind:

* **Price:** While it's not exactly difficult to find budget-friendly laptops for different applications, the term "budget-friendly" means different things to different people. I did my best to ensure that all laptops featured on this list have base retail prices at or below $1,000.
* **User upgrades:** Even if you're looking for a cheap laptop, it's still an investment that you'll want to last at least a few years. I made sure that each pick for the best cheap laptops is able to be user-upgraded in at least one way (RAM, storage, GPU, etc.)
* **Storage:** Whether you want a new, cheap laptop for school work or gaming, having an appropriately sized storage drive is important. For each pick on this list, I made sure that their storage drives matched up to minimum specifications for popular programs used for work, school, gaming, and streaming.

## Is $350 enough for a good laptop?

Don't be fooled -- $350 will not buy you monster system that can do everything. If you are looking for a system that can handle tasks like photo and video editing (or even gaming), then you are looking in the wrong place.

But, if you want a basic system capable of browsing the web (keep the Google Chrome tabs down to a minimum) or making documents and spreadsheets, then these are the systems for you.

## Are desktops cheaper than laptops?

In some cases, a desktop may be cheaper than a laptop, especially if you're looking for a video-editing or gaming device. However, you'll be hard-pressed to find desktops suitable for daily use that can compete with these laptop prices.

The Envy TE01 is the most affordable HP desktop on the market, and its price starts at $450\. In comparison, everything on this list is under $350\. While you may get lucky with a great sale or discount coupon from certain retailers, a desktop that sells for under $400 is very, very rare.

## How much RAM should a laptop have?

Deciding how much RAM your laptop should have, no matter the price, is going to very much depend on how you are going to be using your new laptop. If it's going to be a family computer for web browsing, streaming, and occasional homework assignments, a laptop with just 4 or 8GB of RAM will have more than enough power. However, if your laptop is going to be for gaming or creative work, you'll want at least 16GB to help reduce the risk of bottleneck.

## How much storage should a laptop have?

Much like RAM, how much storage your laptop should have depends entirely on how you'll be using it. For very young students and casual home use laptops, a storage drive of just 128GB will be more than sufficient for documents, photos, and essential programs. For office and creative work or gaming, you'll want to opt for a laptop that has at least a 500GB storage drive to ensure that you'll have plenty of space for raw photo and video files, game libraries, and productivity software. 

Many budget-friendly laptops, like Chromebooks, offer integration with cloud storage services like Dropbox and Google Drive. This means that they'll have very small local drives, but you'll be able to free up space by transferring files to whichever cloud storage service you use. This also means that students can access assignments on other computers if their laptop is having issues or needs repaired.

## Are there alternative cheap laptops worth considering?

There are plenty of options out there if you're looking for an affordable laptop for everyday use. Here's a short list of alternatives that are also solid choices:
