Trying to keep all of your devices both powered up and connected [without sacrificing your workspace](https://www.zdnet.com/article/buying-a-laptop-docking-station-avoid-these-5-mistakes/) can be challenging. There are power strips and USB ports, but using both together won't always accomplish all you need. They will also take up too much room in your bags when [transitioning from work to home](https://www.techwalla.com/articles/what-is-the-purpose-of-a-docking-station).

[Best laptop docking stations: Your essential accessory for working from home There's never been a better time to upgrade your work-from-home setup with a docking station that transforms your laptop into a more comfortable working environment. Here's what you should look for.  Read now](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop-docking-station/)

If you want to keep your devices connected to use them whenever you need to, you don't necessarily need a massive docking station. This [tiny dock with 13 ports](https://stacksocial.com/sales/13-in-1-docking-station-with-dual-hdmi?utm%5Fsource=zdnet.com&utm%5Fmedium=referral&utm%5Fcampaign=13-in-1-docking-station-with-dual-hdmi&utm%5Fterm=scsf-556877&utm%5Fcontent=a0x1P000004yWgUQAU&scsonar=1&aid=a-ceempx7z) may be much less intrusive, especially if you use extra monitors. And during our Deal Days sale, you can get this docking station for only $49.99 or 28% off â€” no coupon necessary. Need more desk essentials? Visit our [Deal Days collection](https://stacksocial.com/collections/deal-days?aid=a-ceempx7z&utm%5Fsource=zdnet.com&utm%5Fmedium=referral&utm%5Fcampaign=deal-days) by October 12 to find additional discounts.

The docking station has three USB 3.0 ports, a USB 2.0 port, and a USB-C port with Power Delivery for super fast charging. They all provide [high-speed transfers](https://stacksocial.com/sales/13-in-1-docking-station-with-dual-hdmi?utm%5Fsource=zdnet.com&utm%5Fmedium=referral&utm%5Fcampaign=13-in-1-docking-station-with-dual-hdmi&utm%5Fterm=scsf-556877&utm%5Fcontent=a0x1P000004yWgUQAU&scsonar=1&aid=a-ceempx7z), so your work efficiency will improve even when connecting slow devices such as a mouse or keyboards. You can also enjoy a high-quality video experience with triple displays thanks to the 60Hz VGA port and two 4K HDMI ports.

Stay connected with a Gigabit Ethernet port, which supports 10/100/1000BASE-T Lan networks. And a 3.5 AUX port will make talking, listening, and recording easier. You even get storage expansion with SD and TF card slots. That's plenty of functionality from a tiny docking station weighing under 3 ounces, less than most USB hubs with half as many ports. And it's only 5.2 inches long, under 2 inches wide, and barely half an inch thick.
