Black Friday may be over, but we're still on the watch for breakout deals for Cyber Monday. Namely, Best Buy had one of the best Chromebook deals this year, with the Lenovo IdeaPad 3 11 -- which retails at $219 and typically sells for $139 -- listed for as low as [$79](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Flenovo-chromebook-3-11-6-hd-laptop-celeron-n4020-4gb-memory-64gb-emmc-onyx-black%2F6500335.p%3FskuId%3D6500335&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1). And that deal is still available headed into Cyber Monday.

The Chrome OS-powered device sports an 11.6-inch display that lends itself to a lighter and more portable footprint. Under the hood are an Intel Celeron N4020 processor, 4G of RAM, and 64GB of storage, which should deliver just enough power and memory for casual use cases like web surfing, streaming movies, responding to emails, and even taking Zoom calls via browser. 

You can expect up to 10 hours of battery life per charge, making the Lenovo Chromebook reliable enough for day-to-day work and play. It also has two USB Type-C ports, two USB 3.1 ports, a microSD card reader, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Some $1,000 MacBooks don't even have this much port selection. 

The IdeaPad 3 typically hovers between the $130-170 price range for deals and offers. At $79, you won't find a new and better Chromebook for less.
