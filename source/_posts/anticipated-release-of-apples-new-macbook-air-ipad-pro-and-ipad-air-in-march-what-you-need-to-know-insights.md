Apple appears to be working on new device releases for the spring, weeks after its [Vision Pro](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-vision%2Fapple-vision-pro&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp) headset [begins shipping](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-vision-pro-shipping-times-tell-us-about-the-demand-for-apples-xr-headset/) and months before the company's WWDC in June. According to different reports, Apple is considering launching a new MacBook Air, iPad Pro, and iPad Air as early as March or April, with upgraded specs.

Reports from [MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/01/21/new-ipads-and-macbook-airs-spring-2024-rumor/) signal that Apple's new MacBook Air will be released with the M3 chip in both 13-inch and 15-inch variants simultaneously. This release would come less than a year after the first [15-inch MacBook Air](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-air-15-laptop-m2-chip-8gb-memory-256gb-ssd-latest-model-midnight%2F6534606.p%3F%26skuId%3D6534606%26utm_source%3Dnarrativ&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) was launched last June.

The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros and 24-inch iMac released in 2023 all feature Apple's latest M3 chip, and it's rumored a new iPad Pro coming this spring could also have the M3 processor.

The new iPad Pro will have an OLED display, which will make it both thinner and more expensive than ever, according to [BGR reports](https://bgr.com/tech/12-9-inch-ipad-air-6-design-just-leaked-with-no-surprises-at-all/). This would be the first [iPad](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/) to feature OLED displays, which are already used on the latest iPhone (with the exception of the iPhone SE) and Apple Watch models. 

The OLED display will deliver an improved contrast ratio and extended battery life, compared to the iPad's current LCD display, as well as a potentially lighter iPad Pro. Due to their nature, OLED panels display true blacks and vibrant colors more efficiently than LCD and feature a faster response time for video games and action movies.

The new iPad Pro could also improve the iPad's ProMotion variable refresh rate spectrum from 24Hz-120Hz to 1Hz-120Hz. The iPhone 14 Pro and 15 Pro feature a variable refresh rate from 1Hz to 120Hz, which can save precious battery life when the screen displays static content, like a photo, or when set to always-on mode. 

Both the 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pro models are also expected to feature a redesigned, less prominent camera bump and to support MagSafe wireless charging.

A new iPad Air also appears to be in the works, which would be the first release since March 2022\. The sixth-generation iPad Air is rumored to come in 11-inch and 12.9-inch variants and feature Apple's M2 chip, a redesigned camera bump, and Wi-Fi 6E support.
