## Discover the Ultimate Chromebook Picks of 2E+24: How HP and Lenovo Stack Up Among Competitors | Insights

Chromebooks have become an increasingly popular option for anyone looking for a budget-friendly or no-nonsense laptop for work, home use, school, and even gaming. Many Chromebooks feature smaller storage drives and RAM capacities to help keep costs down while integrating cloud storage services like Google Drive and Dropbox to help free up local drive space. A ChromeOS laptop can also have a double-digit battery life, making it a great option for mobile professionals and students who may not be able to charge their devices throughout the day.

ZDNET has tested many of the Chromebooks featured on this list, and thoroughly researched the rest to help you find the best fit for your needs as well as your budget. My pick for the best Chromebook is the [HP Dragonfly Pro](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fhp-14-2-in-1-wide-ultra-xga-touch-screen-chromebook-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-ssd-mineral-silver%2F6534595.p%3FskuId%3D6534595&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) for its 11.5 hour battery life, 12th generation Intel Core i5 processor, and 256GB SSD.

ZDNET's own June Wan got some hands-on experience with the [HP Dragonfly Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/hp-dragonfly-pro-chromebook-review/) Chromebook, calling it "possibly the most ambitious Chromebook \[he's\] tested." And I'm inclined to agree. The HP Dragonfly Pro is built with a 12th generation Intel Core i5 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for more than enough power, performance, and storage space for everything from class assignments and office work to web browsing, streaming, and even light gaming with integrated Iris Xe graphics. 

The 14-inch display gives you 1080p resolution as well as touch inputs for more control over your programs and apps. The screen also has a peak brightness of 1,200 nits, making it great for working in harsh overhead lighting or bright sunlight. The laptop features an 8MP front-facing camera for virtual learning, video calls, and basic video recording as well as an RGB backlit keyboard to show off your personal style. And with an 11.5 hour battery life, you can work all day and well into the evening before you need to plug in.

A Chromebook might not be your first choice when shopping for a new or your first gaming laptop, but since ChromeOS is based on Linux, more and more developers are providing ChromeOS support for their games. In March 2022, Steam [released an alpha version](https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3128319763053339626) of the storefront for ChromeOS, which gave Chromebook users access to popular games. The Acer Chromebook 516 GE aims to take your ChromeOS gaming experience further with support for cloud gaming services like Xbox Game Pass and GeForce Now, which allow you to play graphically intense games without expensive hardware.

ZDNET's Michael Gariffo got to test the [Acer Chromebook 516 GE](https://www.zdnet.com/article/acer-chromebook-516-ge-review-as-good-as-cloud-gaming-gets/), calling it "one of the best ways to start cloud gaming at its price point."

## What is the best Chromebook?

My pick for the best Chromebook is the HP Dragonfly Pro for its thin and lightweight design, bright 14-inch touchscreen display, and 11.5-hour battery life. ZDNET's June Wan was able to do some hands-on testing of the HP Dragonfly Pro, and also praised the laptop's integrated, 8MP webcam, and Thunderbolt 4 support. 

| **Best Chromebook**       | **Price** | **CPU/RAM**                                 | **Battery life** |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| HP Dragonfly Pro          | $499      | Up to 12th gen Intel Core i5, Up to 16GB    | 11.5 hours       |
| Lenovo Chromebook Flex 3i | $312      | Up to Intel Pentium Silver N6000, Up to 8GB | 10 hours         |

## Which Chromebook is right for you?

The most important factor to keep in mind while shopping for a new Chromebook, or your first ChromeOS laptop, is: how are you going to use it? 

If you want an affordable Chromebook for casual home use like web browsing and streaming, you'll want a larger screen, at least a 6-hour battery life, and storage and RAM specs that are on the lower end. However, if you want a Chromebook for work, you'll want an option with a larger storage drive, more RAM for more efficient multitasking, plenty of USB and USB-C ports for connecting peripherals and external storage devices, and a double-digit battery life.

Chromebooks are also becoming a popular, budget-friendly option for PC gamers. Gaming Chromebooks are designed to be used with cloud gaming services like GeForce Now and Amazon Luna rather than run games from local files. This allows you to play titles like Minecraft and Among Us without expensive discrete graphics cards or massive storage drives you might not need if you're just an occasional gamer.

## How did we choose these Chromebooks?

While testing and researching the Chromebooks featured in this list, we kept these criteria in mind:

* **Price:** Many people turn to Chromebooks as a more budget-friendly alternative to Windows, macOS, and Linux laptops. We've done our best to ensure that each featured Chromebook has a base starting price of $1,000 or less.
* **Storage and performance:** Whether you're looking for a Chromebook for school or home use, office work, or gaming, it's important to have enough storage and RAM to accommodate your most-used programs and most important files. We've included options with varying storage and RAM capacities to suit different use cases.
* **Battery life and display size:** Laptops are designed to be mobile work or gaming machines, making battery life one of the most important deciding factors. Chromebooks use components that are less power-hungry, allowing them to routinely push the 10-hour range for battery life. I've ensured that each featured Chromebook has at least a 6-hour battery life for tasks like streaming, web browsing, and typical office work.

## What is a Chromebook?

Chromebooks are low-cost laptops made by Google that run on Chrome OS, which is similar to the Google Chrome web browser. They have more basic functionalities than a Windows or macOS laptop and don't have a lot of hard-drive space, but are great for basic use.

## Can you run Windows on a Chromebook?

Yes, but there are a lot of buts when it comes to [Windows on a Chromebook](https://www.zdnet.com/article/parallels-brings-windows-to-chromebooks/), and it's not something the average user will be able to do. Instead, it's much easier to run [Windows apps on a Chromebook](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-run-windows-apps-on-your-chromebook/).

## Do Chromebooks work offline?

There are now plenty of what Google calls "[offline-ready apps](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/3214688)" that can work when the Chromebook is not connected to the internet. That said, the best experience always comes from having the Chromebook connected to the internet for web browsing.

## What are the disadvantages to a Chromebook?

The biggest drawback to owning a Chromebook is the limited storage and memory capacities. Chromebooks often have much, much smaller storage drives and RAM capacities than laptops aimed at PC gamers, creative professionals, and remote workers. This helps keep their costs more reasonable, as well as extends battery life with components that are less power-hungry, but if you need space for a lot of documents, programs, or photo and video files, you'll have to rely on cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox.

## How long do Chromebooks last?

Like Windows, Linux, or macOS based laptops, you should expect a decent Chromebook to give you at least five years of use before you need to upgrade. Since Chromebooks often have much smaller storage and memory capacities than their counterparts, their longevity relies on cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox as well as reasonable user expectations; you won't be able to do things like 3D modeling or animation, but a Chromebook is a perfect option for casual home use, light office work, and classroom assignments.

## Are there alternative Chromebooks worth considering?

There are plenty of choices out there if you're in the market for a Chromebook. Here's a short list of alternative picks:
