## Next Month's Excitement: Predicting What Could Be in the Upcoming Multipair AirPods by Apple | GadgetFocus Forecast

Credible reports assert that Apple has two new versions of [AirPods](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-airpods/) in its back pocket, ready to launch during its annual hardware event. Rumors also swirl that Apple will announce the second generation of its [over-ear headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-over-ear-headphones/), AirPods Max, during the same hardware event. The event, which usually takes place in September, is when the company unveils the latest iPhones, iPads, Macs, and AirPods.

Apple's current AirPods lineup consists of one premium over-ear option, one premium in-ear version, and two base model options with minimal upgraded features. Reports say that Apple's new earbuds will replace the second and third-generation base model AirPods. Here are the features I'd like to see in the upcoming releases.

## 1\. Angled tips only

The AirPods Pro and third-generation AirPods sport angled ear tips, compared to the second-generation AirPods with straight ear tips. Angled ear tips enhance audio clarity, promote a more comfortable fit, and provide a better seal between the earbuds and the ear canal for improved noise isolation.

I would like Apple to retire the second-generation AirPods' design altogether or at least reserve it only for wired EarPods. The design can be uncomfortable and cheap-feeling, leaving customers asking why they're paying $129 for glorified EarPods, which are only $20.

## 2\. Find My speaker

Apple's AirPods Pro 2 feature a small speaker on the bottom of the charging case that rings when you press "Play Sound" in the Find My app. This speaker helps when you know your AirPods are nearby, but you can't pinpoint exactly where they are.

Right now, the AirPods Pro 2 are the only AirPods with this speaker, and I'd like Apple to implement it into all of its Find My-compatible AirPods.

## 3\. Wired listening

There's some indication that Apple will refresh its premium over-ear headphones, the AirPods Max, this year. Almost four years have passed since their release, and plenty of premium over-ear headphone makers have debuted better options regarding functionality and software features.

**Also: [The iOS 18 public beta is available for iPhone right now. How to download it](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-ios-18-public-beta-is-available-for-iphone-right-now-heres-how-to-download-it-and-which-models-support-it/)**

It may be far-fetched to ask Apple to increase the AirPods Max 2's interoperability with non-Apple devices. Still, the company's deviation from Lightning ports to USB-C ports is becoming standard. As a result, we could see the AirPods Max 2 debut with USB-C ports compatible with audio passthrough.

To take my requests a step further, I'd like to see AirPods Max 2's USB-C compatibility allow them to simultaneously play wired audio and charge iPhones with USB-C ports, similar to their distant cousin, the [Beats Studio Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/beats-studio-pro-review/).

## 4\. A power button

One of the AirPods Max's more questionable design features is that the headphones lack a proper on/off button and instead enter low-power mode after you stop using them for several minutes. Many premium headphones, like the [Sonos Ace](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonos-ace-review/) and the [Bose QuietComfort Ultra](https://www.zdnet.com/article/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review/), also feature a sleep mode that conserves the headphones' energy when they sense you haven't used them for a few minutes.

However, these headphones eventually turn themselves off completely after an extended period, while Apple's headphones stay in power-saving mode forever. An on/off button may help listeners conserve battery power and avoid confusion about whether their headphones are _actually_ off.
