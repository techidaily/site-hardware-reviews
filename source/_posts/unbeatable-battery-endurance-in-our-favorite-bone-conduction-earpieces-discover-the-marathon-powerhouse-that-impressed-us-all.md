Earlier this year, I tested the [H2O Audio Tri Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FH2O-Audio-Multi-Sport-Headphones-Built%2Fdp%2FB0BX4ZJVXS%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce95253b6-f966-49dd-b515-4d7c6d667515%7Cdtp&dtb=1) bone conduction headset in the pool and on the streets of Brisbane, Australia. H2O Audio recently announced the [Tri 2](https://h2oaudio.com/products/tri-2-multi-sport-with-bt-mp3?variant=45606688555225) and [Tri 2 Pro](https://h2oaudio.com/products/tri-2-multi-sport-with-bt-mp3?variant=45700139581657) multi-sport headphones, which improve upon the previous generation in several ways.

The $20 price difference between the Tri 2 and Tri 2 Pro is due to the Pro model supporting the unique Playlist Plus functionality that I detailed in [my Tri Pro review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/my-favorite-bone-conduction-headphones-for-swimming-just-got-a-major-audio-upgrade/). I have been testing both models, but H2O Audio halted sales of the Tri 2 Pro to address a Bluetooth battery issue that some customers were experiencing (the updated model should be available soon). 

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS H2O Audio Tri 2 Bone conduction headphones are perfect for maintaining awareness and listening to audio while you exercise. View at H2O Audio](https://h2oaudio.com/products/tri-2-multi-sport-with-bt-mp3?variant=45606688555225)

Comparing the Tri 2 series to the first generation, I found a nearly 100% increase in battery life, improved button design, new bone conduction acoustics, and increased level of water resistance advertised as beyond IPX8\. 

I was satisfied with the five hours or so of battery life with the H2O Tri Pro headset, but having up to nine hours is certainly welcome for the same price as the first generation model. (H2O Audio advertises nine hours for Bluetooth mode and six hours for MP3 mode.)

The first-generation headset is very comfortable, and I enjoyed using it in the pool and out running, but after the Tri 2 headset arrived I immediately noticed the soft touch textured coating. It makes the [H2O Audio Tri 2](https://h2oaudio.com/products/tri-2-multi-sport-with-bt-mp3?variant=45606688555225) models a bit more comfortable. The first generation has a smoother, metallic feel, while the second generation grips onto your head a bit better and feels better in the hand.

The buttons on the H2O Tri Pro are positioned on the outside of the headset, so you press the buttons into your head to activate them. This is fine since the buttons are well spaced out. On the Tri 2 series, however, the buttons are now positioned on the bottom of the right side and are a bit larger.

As a result, when you want to press in on them, you can place your index finger on the top of the right side and squeeze your fingers together. This also allows you to keep the headset in place better than with the first generation.

Unfortunately, there is no large, easily accessible button on the round piece ahead of your ear for playing and pausing music, like on other bone conduction headsets. That said, I easily got used to squeezing the center button.

I've worn the headset for many hours while running and while at the pool, with no discomfort at all. I had my wife and daughter try it in the pool and both of them were amazed by the audio quality from the headset while swimming underwater, as the sound is richer and bolder than when used in the air. This was also my wife's first exposure to bone conduction headsets, and she is now considering using them to help with her tinnitus when listening to music (she is sensitive to the earbuds form factor).

The H2O Audio Tri 2's bone conduction speakers are slimmer by 5mm compared to the Tri series and provide improved sound quality. I still have the first generation and the volume, bass, and clarity is better on the Tri 2 models than on the first generation. I would not have thought H2O Audio could improve upon the sound, but the company pulled it off. 

H2O Audio also provides a smartphone app for managing your music, designating favorites, updating your headset firmware, and more. The app also shows your battery life and headset storage usage.

##  ZDNET's buying advice 

The [H2O Audio Tri 2](https://h2oaudio.com/products/tri-2-multi-sport-with-bt-mp3?variant=45606688555225) and Tri 2 Pro bone conduction headsets are excellent choices if you're looking for headphones to use while in the water or for headphones with integrated music. Indeed, the Pro 2 model with Playlist Plus support lets you take your favorite music from Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, or other subscription service with you for offline playback.
