* They deliver plenty of bass and decent mids with long-lasting comfort.
* The highs in these earbuds aren't nearly as crisp as they should be, and they're missing the three-tap track repeat gesture.

Before testing these earbuds, I had never heard of the Tagry brand. So when I received a pair of [X08 earbuds](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB09LD2D1TV%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce0c25071-fb7a-45f0-af25-0d96c9a2f1e8%7Cdtp&dtb=1), I decided to not do any research before the first listen; I wanted to be completely unbiased. 

I'm glad I went that route. Had I known they cost less than $40, I would have automatically assumed the audio quality would sound cheap. Boy was I surprised.

**Also:** [**These Beyerdynamic headphones made me a believer in the open-ear form factor**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-beyerdynamic-headphones-made-me-a-believer-in-the-open-ear-form-factor/)

Before I go any further, I don't want to mislead anyone. These earbuds will not in any way stand up to the likes of the [Denon PerL Pro earbuds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-was-skeptical-of-these-350-wireless-earbuds-until-they-knocked-my-socks-off/) which, for me, are the gold standard when it comes to earbuds. Although the X08s don't have the dynamic range or quality of noise cancellation found in the Denons, these inexpensive earbuds sound like they cost more than they actually do. 

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Tagry X08 earbuds These earbuds punch well above their price point to deliver solid bass, good battery life, and all day comfort.

## Tagry X08 earbuds tech specs

## My experience

As I mentioned, when I first connected the X08 earbuds, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the sound was. And when I looked up the price, I was seriously impressed.

As usual, I cranked up my go-to test track, Rush's "Analog Kid" for the first listen and found the bass to be more agile than expected. It wasn't muddy and I could clearly hear Geddy's bassline with ease. The X08s didn't seem to be boosting the bass to uncomfortable levels, it was just right. 

**Also: [I'm an audiophile, and these $150 headphones had me fooled](https://www.zdnet.com/article/im-an-audiophile-and-these-150-headphones-had-me-fooled/)**

It's only when you get to the upper mids and highs that you start to notice the X08s biggest weakness. These earbuds aren't capable of offering the crisp highs necessary to really round out the sound. That's not to say the highs are poor, they just don't quite match up to the bass. 

But given the price of these earbuds, you knew there'd be something, and the audio quality around the highs are that something. I'm not saying they're non-existent, but if you love the sound of a high hat, you'll find the X08 earbuds lack on delivering that "sizzle."

You can get up to 60 hours of playtime with the X08s with the charging case

Of course, most consumers put more emphasis on bass than mids or highs, and in that respect, you'll find that these deliver. They may not be quite as punchy at the bottom as other earbuds, but they do have plenty of low end. The X08s are also comfortable, and are so light (0.14 oz per earbud) that they won't fatigue your ears or easily fall out.

**Also: [I replaced my Shokz with these bone conduction headphones - and can't go back](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-replaced-my-shokz-with-these-bone-conduction-headphones-and-cant-go-back/)**

I did have one instance where my Pixel 8 Pro assumed it was connected to the earbuds but instead, the sound came from the phone's speaker. I can't be certain if the problem was due to the earbuds or the phone, but a restart of my Pixel solved the problem. 

As far as the controls are concerned, the standard taps apply. The only tap control missing is the three-tap track repeat (something I frequently use when running).

## ZDNET's buying advice

Although I wouldn't recommend the [Tagry X08 earbuds](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FTAGRY-Bluetooth-Headphones-Earphones-Waterproof%2Fdp%2FB09LD2D1TV%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce0c25071-fb7a-45f0-af25-0d96c9a2f1e8%7Cdtp&dtb=1) to an audiophile, I would gladly recommend them to anyone who values a good deal or is looking for an inexpensive pair of earbuds for the gym or travel. Also, if you primarily listen to audiobooks or podcasts, these earbuds are a perfect match; you can wear them for hours and not feel the slightest discomfort.

At $35, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better deal on a pair of solid-sounding earbuds. Although these aren't going to have you headbanging like [Denon PerL Pros](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-was-skeptical-of-these-350-wireless-earbuds-until-they-knocked-my-socks-off/) would, you'll certainly be able to enjoy your music with a quality that belies the price.
