### ZDNET's key takeaways

* Moft's Laptop Carry Sleeve is available now for $70 on Amazon and the company's site.
* Its thoughtful design doubles as a sleek laptop sleeve and a 15- or 25-degree stand.
* It's a niche product that requires commitment to a minimalist aesthetic, and the PU leather might not be for everyone.

[$69.99 at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08DRBFCNK%3FlinkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cb422cb83-6baf-4e97-8eef-b3f2ac6e4261%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

As a hybrid worker, I'm always on the lookout for new products that make commuting with my laptop(s) easier. Part of the ongoing struggle is reducing the amount of _stuff_ I carry around every day. I like keeping it as minimal as possible. It's even better if I can find well-designed products that offer multiple uses.

I recently had a chance to test out one such product that fits this description to a tee. The vegan leather [Laptop Carry Sleeve](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMOFT-Computer-Expandable-Adjustable-Ultra-Slim%2Fdp%2FB08DR93Z54%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cb422cb83-6baf-4e97-8eef-b3f2ac6e4261%7Cdtp&dtb=1) from thoughtful tech accessory company [Moft](https://www.moft.us/) takes a minimal but functional design approach, acting as multiple products in one, and looking good while doing it. 

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Moft Laptop Carry Sleeve Moft's laptop carry sleeve is a smart portability solution for those who like to work with an elevated laptop stand. View at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMOFT-Computer-Expandable-Adjustable-Ultra-Slim%2Fdp%2FB08DRBFCNK%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cb422cb83-6baf-4e97-8eef-b3f2ac6e4261%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

Essentially, it's a foldable carry sleeve for your laptop that doubles as a stand. It can be positioned into a few different configurations to elevate your laptop, then folds down flat again when you're done. 

The sleeve offers either a 15-degree or 25-degree stand, depending on how angled you like your device. While elevated, it feels secure and natural, with the fold at the bottom-center cleverly placed to prevent the laptop from sliding forward. 

The whole thing stays put on whatever surface you have it on thanks to the material's texture. It's constructed from a fiberglass "leather" material from recycled industrial material that feels very similar to real leather, if a little plasticky.

The sleeve I used was in the Sienna Brown colorway, but I imagine other colors might look more or less like real leather. The stitching and construction of the sleeve feels well-made, with the creases and folds indicating how to position the sleeve's different configurations.

**Also: [One of the best lightweight laptops I've tested is a remote worker's dream machine](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-best-lightweight-laptops-ive-tested-is-a-remote-workers-dream-machine/)**

There is also some (very) limited space inside the sleeve to allow for some extra storage of a few credit or debit cards, as well as room for paper or a few folders, but not much else. This is not something you'd be able to overload with other gear.

You won't fit your charger in here, nor will a mouse or other peripherals fit; It's a minimalist product designed solely for the laptop and not much else. The tradeoff is its extremely thin footprint in your backpack.

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

The carry sleeve comes in two versions: one for 13-inch or 14-inch laptops, and one for 15-inch or 16-inch laptops (you won't be able to fit a larger device into the smaller one; I tried). You can still use the small sleeve as a stand for a 16-inch laptop. I was able to position my 16-inch Dell Latitude just fine, although my 13-inch MacBook Pro fit better.

Although the sleeve looks great when it's new, I do wonder how it will hold up over time, especially since polyurethane leather isn't exactly known for being the most sustainable material long term. In the one week or so that I've been using it, it seems fine, if a little fingerprinty.

At any rate, this isn't something you'd want to expose to a dirty table in the coffee shop, or spill a drink on. Keep that in mind if you're working somewhere in public.

## ZDNET's buying advice

I recommend [Moft's Laptop Carry Sleeve](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMOFT-Computer-Expandable-Adjustable-Ultra-Slim%2Fdp%2FB08DRBFCNK%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cb422cb83-6baf-4e97-8eef-b3f2ac6e4261%7Cdtp&dtb=1) to anyone who prefers working on an elevated laptop, and values multipurpose, well-designed products that occupy minimal space. If you're looking for a big, cushy laptop sleeve with padding, zippers, and extra slots, this is not the sleeve for you. Nevertheless, it's a solid addition to your tech commuter pack if you're interested in thoughtful, multipurpose gear.
