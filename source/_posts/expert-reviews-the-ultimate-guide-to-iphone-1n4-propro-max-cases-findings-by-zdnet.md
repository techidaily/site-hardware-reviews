What do you prioritize after you purchase the newest iPhone? You probably want to protect your investment with the best iPhone case. One that's slim, durable, and maybe even good for the planet.

Kevin Zhou, CEO and founder of [Repart](https://irepart.com/), a cell phone repair parts manufacturer, wanted a durable case that would safeguard the iPhone 14 from any damage. "Longevity is an aspect I was looking for," Zhou told ZDNET. "I cannot go around searching for phone cases repeatedly, so I settled for an option that would serve me for years."

Sustainable cases last and are made with quality materials. "I chose [a biodegradable case made from cornstarch.](https://www.wavecase.co.uk/shop/p/iphone-14-pro)," Diana Leenders, an Etsy SEO specialist and co-founder of [EtsyGeeks.org](http://etsygeeks.org/), told ZDNET. "It's held up really well with time and has provided adequate protection."

Two aspects of the case that stand out performance-wise are the 10-foot drop protection and improved MagSafe charging due to built-in magnets that are 50% thicker than most other phone cases.

Plus, when you're ready to switch phones, you can either compost the case in your home garden or return it to A Good Company -- the factory will recycle it.

A Good Company donates 4% of every purchase you make to [A Good Foundation,](https://agood.com/blogs/a-good-foundation) which supports sustainability initiatives around the world. Plus, the cases are reasonably priced at under $30, and ship plastic free. They have various case designs and a MagSafe ring that you can add to your order for an additional $15.

### Urban Sophistication The Puffer Case

As you pull on your puffer jacket this winter, bundle up your iPhone, too -- with a puffer case.

However, the plush case actually isn't bulky, so it can easily fit into your pocket or bag. It has raised edges for screen and camera protection and full side button coverage. It's also water-resistant -- just wipe the case with a wet cloth to clean it.

While the price is relatively steep at $65, the feel might be worth the cost. Urban Sophistication says this case feels "like your favorite pillow... like the puffiest coat... like a marshmallow." Is anyone else intrigued? 

Urban Sophistication continues to roll out more options. Right now, most colors are compatible with the iPhone 14 Max and Pro Max.

## How did we choose these phone cases?

We considered various factors when analyzing the best iPhone cases on the market. The most important factors are sustainability, durability, affordability, and aesthetic. 

Each case on this list also has a different texture. You would notice a material difference between A Good Company's linseed case and the wheat-based Wave Case. Prices points also vary, especially between the Wave Case and the Zagg Brooklyn Snap -- but the premium vegan leather of the Zagg might be worth the higher cost for you.
