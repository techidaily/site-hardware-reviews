 The keyboard on your Android phone is probably pretty good at correcting and predicting words, but what about words it doesn't know? You'll have to teach it to know those words, but it's not hard to do.

 Things like names, obscure towns or cities, street names, and pet names may not be known by your keyboard. Rather than manually correct the keyboard every time it tries to change those words, you can add them to the "dictionary." We'll show you how to do this with Google's Gboard and Samsung's keyboard.

##  How to Add a Word in Gboard

 First, we'll be using Google's [Gboard](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU219094/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.inputmethod.latin) keyboard. Any Android device [can use this keyboard](https://extra-hints.techidaily.com/2024-approved-construct-humor-memes-via-adobe/) and it's the default on Pixel phone. Enter a text box anywhere to bring up the keyboard. and type the word you would like to add.

![Type a word.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2022-01-07_16-59-49.png) 

 A red line will appear under the word if it's not in the dictionary. Tap the word and select "Add to Dictionary."

![Add the word to the dictionary.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2022-01-07_17-00-05.png) 

 That's all there is to it. The word will now be suggested in the future.

##  How to Add a Word in Samsung Keyboard

 Samsung's keyboard is not as intuitive when it comes to adding words to the dictionary. First, enter a text box to bring up the keyboard.

![Samsung Keyboard.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2022-01-07_17-08-29.png) 

 Type the word you would like to add. Tap the checkmark to accept the spelling.

![Tap the checkmark.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2022-01-07_17-09-29.png) 

 Tap backspace to select the word again and tap it in the suggestion row.

![Select word in suggestion row.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2022-01-07_17-10-48.png) 

 The word is now saved and it will appear as a suggestion in the future.

![Suggested new word.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/2022-01-07_17-11-05.png) 

 Other keyboards will have their own ways of doing this, but they should be similar. So your mileage may vary, but hopefully, this will stop some of those [autocorrect mishaps](https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/updated-top-3g-networks-and-plans-for-gamers-on-a-budget-for-2024/)!
