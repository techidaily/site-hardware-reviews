[Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/topic/microsoft/) is refreshing several Surface models with a greater focus on enterprising users. The changes the company is introducing aren't anything we haven't seen before, but they are notable upgrades that improve usability. While price points remain up in the air, we do know when the new enterprise models are expected to roll out.

On September 26, the tech giant is launching new versions of the Surface Pro 10 and [Surface Pro 11th Edition](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-tablet-i-recommend-most-for-business-travel-is-not-an-ipad-or-thinkpad/) that are capable of running on T-Mobile's 5G network. With it, you won't have to worry about not having connectivity or being unable to show teammates the project you're working on outside the office. [5G support](https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-are-5g-and-edge-computing-and-why-should-you-care/) allows users to enjoy high-speed internet wherever they go. Of course, all the features that make these devices great are making a return.

The Surface Pro 10 will still be powered by an Intel Ultra Core processor, ensuring "versatility \[and\] fast performance." The glass remains covered in an anti-reflective coating for better outdoor visibility, and the device is rated to have a 14-hour battery life.

The Surface Pro 11 is part of the [Copilot+ PC series](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-copilot-pc-microsoft-just-announced-to-take-on-apples-m3-macbooks/#link={), much like the consumer-level model. This means the computer runs on Qualcomm's hardware, including your choice of either the Snapdragon X Elite or the X Plus chipset. The hardware's neural processing unit (NPU for short) powers several AI features, such as eliminating background noise in calls and improving video call clarity.

If you don't plan on traveling with the Surface Pro, Microsoft will also be selling a Wi-Fi-only option a little earlier on September 10.

Microsoft's Surface Laptop 7 sees multiple upgrades from its predecessor. Not only will it have the option to house one of the Snapdragon X chipsets, but it will also gain some design tweaks and features. It now supports [Wi-Fi 7](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/what-is-wi-fi-7-and-just-how-fast-is-it/) connectivity, has additional ports, sports a brighter display "with ultra-thin bezels" around the glass, 22 hours of battery life, and an upgraded touchpad. 

**Also: [The Windows 10 clock is ticking: 5 ways to save your old PC in 2025 (most are free)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-windows-10-clock-is-ticking-5-ways-to-save-your-old-pc-in-2025-most-are-free/)**

That revamped touchpad, according to Microsoft, "delivers realistic feedback when" touched. Plus, it comes with "intuitive touch gestures for easier navigation." This revamped laptop launches on September 10\. If it's anything like the [consumer model](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tried-microsofts-new-surface-laptop-copilot-pc-and-it-beat-my-macbook-air-in-3-ways/), which we expect it to be, the Surface Laptop 7 is looking to be a promising device for enterprise users.

Finally, the tech giant is updating its Surface Keyboard. It is mostly the same, but the accessory now has a Copilot key enabling "one-touch access" to the AI features on Windows 11\. The revamped keyboard will be released on October 3\.
