## Ultimate Guide to the Premier Audio for Gamers : Comprehensive Testing Results

A gaming speaker or a dedicated sound system can elevate your experience and let you enjoy your favorite games' music and sound design without using a headset. Many gaming speakers work with audio processing drivers such as DTS or Dolby to provide crystal-clear dialogue, deep bass notes, and crisp music. 

Speakers that support Dolby Atmos or DTS Virtual:X Ultra can create virtual, 3D surround sound, mimicking object and position-relevant spatial audio. This enables you to pinpoint in-game sound cues like footsteps and enemy fire, helping you regroup or press your advantage. 

Many gaming speakers support multiple platforms, such as Windows, iOS, and Android operating systems, as well as consoles like the PlayStation 5 or Nintendo Switch, allowing you to use a single solution for all your gaming devices.

### Best gaming speaker overall

The Logitech G560 is one of the best gaming speaker systems you can buy for your PC. It connects to your computer, console, or mobile device via USB or Bluetooth, providing a completely wireless setup or a more reliable hardwired connection. The dual speakers and dedicated subwoofer offer up to 240 watts of peak power, producing up to 97 decibels of volume so you can feel and hear deep bass tones and clear mid and high notes.

The G560 also uses DTS:X Ultra virtual surround sound to recreate spatial and positional audio, making it easier to pinpoint in-game sound cues. Additionally, the speakers work with Logitech's Lightsync RGB lighting system, allowing you to customize four lighting zones on each speaker with over 16 million colors. You can even set the RGB lighting to react to in-game audio, such as music, gunfire, or explosions, adding more visual flair to your Twitch streams or personal gaming sessions. Verified customer reviews from Amazon agree that the system is fast and easy to set up and features intuitive controls for creating custom audio settings.

## SteelSeries Arena 9

### Best premium gaming speaker

If you want to invest in a high-end, dedicated gaming speaker system, the SteelSeries Arena 9 is an excellent option. It uses a combination of wired and wireless speakers and a dedicated subwoofer to provide 5.1CH true surround sound for your gaming space. 

The rear speakers are wireless, giving you plenty of freedom to create custom configurations, while the wired speakers provide precise delivery of high and mid-tones. The 6.5-inch subwoofer has a downward-firing diaphragm, directing those powerful bass notes into the floor so you can feel as much as hear them. 

This was especially evident when I fired up Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight to test the Arena 9's different EQ settings. Synth bass lines and kick drums thrumming wonderfully through the subwoofer and satellite speakers.

**Read the review: [The most immersive speaker system I've ever tested isn't from Bose or Sonos](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/steelseries-arena-review/)**

A separate control pod lets you easily adjust volume, create custom EQ settings, switch connection options, and more. The OLED screen creates crystal-clear text, so you never have to use trial and error to know each function. 

You can connect the Arena 9 to your Windows or Mac PC, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X via USB or Bluetooth, while a 3.5mm AUX and Optical cables allow you to connect to mobile devices and televisions. 

Verified reviews from Amazon and Best Buy love the versatility of the Arena 9 for gaming, streaming movies, shows, and music with dedicated EQ settings, as well as the Sonar software customization features.

## Samsung HW-S50B

### Best gaming speaker for consoles

This Samsung soundbar is a great option for console gamers looking to boost their audio quality or enhance their TV's output with Dolby Digital 5.1CH and DTS Virtual:X support. It also uses Samsung's adaptive sound technology to automatically analyze and balance sound for better voice clarity in shows, movies, and music. The dedicated music mode is perfect for audiophiles looking for a multifunctional soundbar for a shared gaming and entertainment space.

You connect your console to the soundbar via HDMI ARC or optical if you prefer a hardwired setup, or you can use Bluetooth or NFC connectivity for a wireless, clutter-free area. You can even set up dual Bluetooth connections at once, letting you quickly and easily switch from work or streaming to gaming with the tap of a button. And with two subwoofers and three tweeter speakers built into the soundbar, you'll get rich, full sound without overwhelming your space.

## Razer Leviathan V2 X

### Best design

For gamers who want a speaker that looks as good as it sounds, the Razer Leviathan V2 X combines a compact design, customizable RGB lighting, and personalized EQ settings to create a more immersive experience. You can connect the Leviathan V2 X to your computer or console via Bluetooth or USB-C, letting you choose between a clean, wireless setup or a more reliable wired connection when needed.

If you choose a Bluetooth connection, you can set up multiple devices and switch between them on the fly with the Razer Audio app. The Audio app also lets you create custom EQ profiles to suit different game genres, music, and voice chat. 

You can also use the Razer Synapse desktop app to customize the RGB lighting. The 14 lighting zones can be customized with one of Razer's pre-programmed color and pattern schemes or set to react to in-game audio and music, adding more visual flair to personal gaming sessions or live streams. 

Verified reviews from Amazon and Best Buy love the compact design of the Leviathan V2 X, which allows them to place it directly on a gaming desk rather than on a dedicated shelf.

## What is the best gaming speaker?

My pick for the best gaming speaker is the Logitech G560\. This sound system features 7.1CH audio and DTS:X Ultra Surround Sound drivers for clean, immersive audio. 

The desktop speakers also feature reactive RGB lighting that pulses with your music or in-game sound effects, an excellent feature for content creators and streamers who want to add more visual flair to their videos and live streams. 

The dedicated subwoofer ensures you get deep, satisfying bass notes in epic game soundtracks and in-game audio cues like explosions. The entire system can also have Bluetooth connectivity for a completely wireless setup.

## Which gaming speaker is right for you?

Space is the most significant factor when purchasing a dedicated gaming speaker or sound system for your game room. There are compact options that are great for multi-monitor setups or desks that are on the smaller side. However, if you're a console gamer, you'll have to do a lot of measuring to make sure your bookshelf speakers, sound bars, or subwoofers will 1) fit in your space and 2) not rattle your neighbors and roommates awake when you want to squeeze in a few rounds of Apex before bed.

You'll also want to consider speakers with integrated Dolby or DTS audio processing, which can provide object-spatial audio without a headset. This allows you to pinpoint audio cues like enemy footsteps and gunfire to press your advantage or fall back and regroup.

## Factors to consider:

While shopping for a set of gaming speakers, there are a few things to keep in mind before making a purchase:

* **Price:** Setting and sticking to a budget not only helps prevent overspending but also helps you focus on getting the best value for your money. Keeping to a budget lets you narrow your choices for easier comparisons between features like Dolby vs. DTS audio, RGB lighting, and connectivity options.
* **Connectivity:** Nothing is worse than opening a set of fancy gaming speakers only to discover that they won't connect to your gaming PC for whatever reason. Many new models use Bluetooth for wireless connectivity, which is great for smaller spaces where wires can be a trip hazard. Others use USB or 3.5mm AUX hardwire connections. Double-check your speakers and PC to make sure they'll be compatible.
* **Compatibility:** Not all gaming speakers are created equal. While the majority are made for use exclusively with PCs and laptops, some offer compatibility with Android and iOS mobile devices, game consoles like the PS5 or Nintendo Switch, and even alternative PC operating systems like Linux and MacOS. Double-check your speakers to ensure they're compatible with whatever you use to play games.

## How we tested these gaming speakers

While testing and researching each set of gaming speakers featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind:

* **Audio quality:** Just because a set of gaming speakers is expensive doesn't automatically mean they'll provide a high-end audio experience. Many mid-range and budget-friendly models offer excellent audio quality via Dolby or DTS support, built-in subwoofers, and high-quality interference reduction-like insulation.
* **Simultaneous connectivity:** Gamers rarely stick to a single platform anymore, making it essential for quality gaming speakers to connect to multiple devices simultaneously or quickly and easily connect and disconnect when switching between consoles, mobile devices, and PCs/laptops.
* **EQ profiles:** Many new gaming speakers are supported by proprietary desktop apps that allow you to create custom equalization profiles for everything from streaming shows and movies to live streaming, recording podcasts, and even game-specific audio profiles to get the most out of your new audio system.

## Which sound format is best for gaming?

All digital audio processing drivers will give you great sound for both PC and console gaming. However, not all audio drivers and technology are created equal. Dolby is the undisputed king of home audio, and gaming speakers that use Dolby Atmos can create virtual surround sound for a more immersive experience without a headset. 

Another popular audio driver is DTS, which is similar to Dolby's basic offerings. It boosts bass notes for bone-rattling boss music and explosions and isolates mid and high tones for crystal-clear dialogue and cleaner music tracks.

## Is Dolby Atmos worth it for gaming?

The folks over at [Xbox certainly think so](https://professional.dolby.com/gaming/#:~:text=Xbox%20Series%20X%20and%20Xbox%20Series%20S%20will%20be%20the%20first%20consoles%20ever%20to%20enable%20gaming%20in%20both%20Dolby%20Vision%20and%20Dolby%20Atmos.). But if you don't want to take their word for it, here's a breakdown of what Dolby Atmos is and what it can do for your gaming audio:

At its core, Dolby Atmos is an audio processing algorithm designed to replicate true surround sound in single or dual-speaker setups. If you invest in a dedicated sound system for your PC or console gaming setup, a Dolby Atmos-enabled soundbar or speakers can replicate the spatial audio you experience with high-end gaming headsets. This means that even without a headset, you can still clearly pick up in-game audio cues like footsteps, enemy fire, or environmental sounds.

Gaming with a soundbar also means you will have more freedom to move about your space, mainly if you use wireless controllers, mice, and keyboards. Plus, you will not have to worry about charging a headset during gaming sessions.

The downside of a dedicated Dolby Atmos-enabled sound system is the space it takes up. Even the smallest soundbars and bookshelf speakers take up more space than a typical headset, so you will want to plan and take measurements to ensure everything will fit. You also need to be considerate of your roommates and neighbors, so choose a soundbar or speaker system that will not disturb everyone in the early morning hours while still providing you with a more immersive gaming experience.

## What do pro gamers use for sound?

It depends on the type of pro gamers. ESports pros will almost exclusively use headsets to communicate with teammates during tournaments, and headsets also allow them to focus on crucial in-game audio cues instead of a noisy stadium. Content creators like Twitch streamers and YouTubers use a mix of headsets and dedicated sound systems. Headsets are perfect for capturing audio and voice chat in multiplayer games since recording and playback hardware and software are built into a single, convenient unit.

However, dedicated sound systems are better for pre-recorded long plays, where a creator may want to appreciate the game's sound design, dialogue, and music with more robust audio technology. This setup also requires a dedicated microphone and noise-isolation/cancellation software to separate the creator's voice track from the ambient and game audio for easier editing and cleaner commentary sound.

## What are some important features to look for when choosing a gaming speaker?

When choosing a gaming speaker, important features to consider include audio quality, compatibility with your device, connectivity options, and the size and shape of the speaker to ensure it fits in your gaming space.

## Do I need a subwoofer with my gaming speaker?

While it's not essential, having a subwoofer can greatly enhance your gaming experience by providing deep, powerful bass notes that help to immerse you in the game.

## What is Dolby Atmos, and do I need it in my gaming speaker?

Dolby Atmos is an audio processing technology that creates a three-dimensional sound experience, making pinpointing sound cues in games easier. While it's unnecessary to have in your gaming speaker, it can greatly enhance your gaming experience if your games support it.
