## Explore the Ultimate List: The Best 5G Notebook Picks for Tech Enthusiasts - Featured

You only need to watch a couple of mobile carrier commercials to know that 5G is the biggest thing in wireless connectivity, offering speeds that rival broadband in places where Wi-Fi often can't reach. It's compatible with existing 4G LTE networks, and despite its increased speeds, 5G can theoretically consume less power and resources than previous wireless networks.

As we explain in our list of [top 4G laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-4g-laptop/), there aren't a ton of options for laptops that include cellular modems, as the vast majority of portables rely on Wi-Fi networks to connect you to the internet. Given its newness in the market, that's especially true when it comes to 5G. 

**Also:** [**Best cheap 5G phones**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cheap-5g-phones/)

However, there's definitely a market for 5G laptops today, as more employers and schools support remote environments. Ranging in price from $500 to over $2,500, these 5G laptops should keep you connected at the highest speeds, even when you're not plugged in.

Pros 
* Cheapest Windows 5G option
* Good battery life

Cons 
* Basic specs

## Samsung Galaxy Book Go 5G

### Best 5G laptop overall

**Tech specs: Display:** 14 inches (1920 x 1080 pixel resolution) | **CPU:** Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 | **RAM:** 4GB | **Storage:** 128GB | **Weight:** 3lbs | **Battery Life:** 18 hours

The Galaxy Book Go is your cheapest option for a 5G-equipped Windows laptop, running less than $600 in AT&T or Verizon compatible versions. It keeps its price down by using Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 chip, which compensates for basic performance with a 5G modem and excellent battery life (18 hours, according to Samsung). 

Other specs on this machine are minimal (4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage), but the 14-inch display offers full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution. It's also highly portable at just 3 pounds, and its shockproof chassis should provide extra durability.

Pros 
* 2-in-1 design
* Outstanding battery life

Cons 
* Snapdragon processor platform is a bit slow
* High price

## Acer Spin 7

### Best 2-in-1 5G laptop

**Tech specs: Display:** 14-inch touchscreen (1920 x 1080 pixel resolution) | **CPU:**  Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 | **RAM:** 8GB | **Storage:** 512GB | **Weight:** 3.1lbs | **Battery Life:** 29 hours

The Acer Spin 7 is a more advanced version of the Galaxy Book Go concept -- at roughly three times the price. It also relies on the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 5G Compute Platform for processing and 5G connectivity, but it offers a lot more for its $1,600 price tag. 

For starters, the Spin 7 is a 2-in-1 rather than a traditional clamshell laptop, which means its full HD 14-inch display has touchscreen functionality with the included digital stylus. It also comes with double the RAM of the Galaxy Book Go and a lot more storage (512GB). A bigger built-in battery boosts the claimed battery life to an astounding 29 hours between charge sessions while only adding a little bit more weight and thickness to the Spin 7 chassis compared to the Galaxy Book Go.

Pros 
* Intel Core 5 processor
* High-quality
* Reliable

Cons 
* Extremely high price
* Only 128GB of storage

## Dell Latitude 9420 2-in-1

### Best powerful 5G laptop

**Tech specs: Display:** 14-inch touchscreen (2560 x 1600 pixel resolution) | **CPU:** Intel Core i5-1135G7 | **RAM:** 8GB | **Storage:** 128GB | **Weight:** 2.8lbs | **Battery Life:** Not listed

Unlike the Acer Spin 7, the Latitude 9420 2-in-1 uses a more familiar and powerful Intel Core i5 processor for business users that need convenient performance. As a result, the 5G modem is a pricey add-on, requiring an update to touchscreen LCD in addition to a Qualcomm 5G modem.

**Check out: [Dell Latitude 9420 review](https://www.zdnet.com/product/dell-latitude-9420-2-in-1-14-core-i7-1185g7-evo-vpro-16-gb-ram-256-gb-ssd-with-3-year-prosupport-nbd/)**

That puts you over $2,500 for a laptop that still only comes with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. On the plus side, you get a featherweight aluminum system with a pair of Thunderbolt 4 ports, QHD+ resolution (2560 x 1600) and 16:10 aspect ratio on screen. You also get peace of mind, knowing you've purchased from Dell's well-respected Latitude lineup.

Cons

## HP Elite Dragonfly Max

### Best splurge 5G laptop

**Tech specs: Display:** 13.3-inch touchscreen (1920 x 1080 pixel resolution) | **CPU:** Intel Core i7-1185G7 | **RAM:** 16GB | **Storage:** 512GB | **Weight:** 2.5bs | **Battery Life:** 11+ hours

The Elite Dragonfly Max is a rival to the Latitude 9420 as a 5G-equipped business 2-in-1 laptop. It's even pricier than the Dell, though you definitely receive your money's worth for that additional $100\. The HP has a more powerful Core i7 chip. Plus, it offers twice the RAM and a 512GB drive compared to the Latitude's more meager specs.

Like the ThinkPad X13 5G, the Dragonfly Max features a 13.3-inch full HD display compared to the 14-inch Latitude screen with higher resolution. However, it counters that with a blinding 1,000 nits of brightness. For the price, HP could probably throw in its digital stylus to use with the touchscreen. Otherwise, the Elite Dragonfly Max packs everything else you need.

Pros 
* Great battery life

Cons 
* Lackluster performance

## Lenovo Flex 5G

### Best original 5G laptop

**Tech specs: Display:** 14 inches (1920 x 1080 pixel resolution) | **CPU:**  Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx | **RAM:** 8GB | **Storage:** 256GB | **Weight:** 2.9lbs | **Battery Life:** 25 hours

While AT&T had to wait to get its ThinkPad X13 5G, Verizon got first dibs with Lenovo's Flex 5G, the debut laptop with 5G connectivity. It offers the Flex 5G for a price similar to AT&T's ThinkPad, but you get a system that's a year older.

Instead of a new 11th-generation Intel Core processor, the Flex 5G is built around the original Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx processor, which is a generation older than the chip used in the Galaxy Book Go and the Spin 7\. You can expect stellar battery life, but performance may seem a bit lackluster, especially for a $1,400 notebook.

## What is the best 5G laptop?

The best 5G laptop is the Samsung Galaxy Book Go due to its battery life, display, and competitive price.

| **5G laptop**             | **Price** | **CPU**                       | **Storage** |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Samsung Galaxy Book Go    | $610      | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 | 128GB       |
| Acer Spin 7               | $700      | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 | 512GB       |
| Dell Latitude 9420 2-in-1 | $2,060    | Intel Core i5-1135G7          | 128GB       |
| HP Elite Dragonfly Max    | $2,581    | Intel Core i7-1185G7          | 512GB       |
| Lenovo Flex 5G            | $1,400    | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8cx       | 256GB       |

## Which 5G laptop is right for you?

You basically have two options if you want a 5G laptop: the Qualcomm Snapdragon or the Intel processor. Snapdragon-powered systems offer you better battery life for a lower price. However, they don't perform as well as laptops running with an Intel Core CPU. 

If you travel often and only need 5G to perform basic computing tasks and web surfing, then Snapdragon-based laptops may work well for you. But road warriors who heavily rely on productivity software will be better off with business-friendly Intel-based 5G laptops.

| **Choose this 5G laptop...** | **If you want...**                     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Samsung Galaxy Book Go       | The best overall option                |
| Acer Spin 7                  | A 2-in-1 5G laptop with great features |
| Dell Latitude 9420 2-in-1    | A power-driven 5G laptop               |
| HP Elite Dragonfly Max       | A 5G laptop that's worth the splurge   |
| Lenovo Flex 5G               | The first 5G laptop ever made          |

## How did we choose these 5G laptops?

As with our [4G laptops list](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-4g-laptop/), 5G-capable models are limited, making it relatively simple to analyze the best options on the market. While there are a few [Chromebooks](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-chromebook-laptop/) and [Microsoft Surface devices](https://www.zdnet.com/article/which-microsoft-surface-pc-is-right-for-you/) with 4G connectivity, the same can't be said about 5G today. A couple of notebooks on the 4G list -- notably the Samsung Galaxy Chromebook Go and the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 9 -- offer configurations with 5G cellular modems, too.

As a still-emergent technology, 5G in laptops may not be optimized yet. But you can expect more systems -- including those with more mainstream price tags -- to offer 5G support over the next couple of years as carriers continue to roll out the technology.

## What are the advantages of using 5G laptops?

5G laptops can provide quicker speeds and lower latency, resulting in faster transmission rates. Moreover, they're more future proof, as manufacturers create devices for the 5G networks. 

However, coverage areas for 5G vary. Your cellular provider can tell you if you're in a 5G zone.
