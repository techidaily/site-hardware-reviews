## Story 3: The Cross-Sectional Survey Misconception

Motorola is beefing up its lineup with a new mid-range smartphone, the 2024 Moto Edge. It features a big battery and screen, an IP68 water-resistance rating, a customizable Quick Button, and a neat $550 price tag.

 Maybe you're familiar with last year's Moto Edge. It was a solid phone, packing a curved 6.6-inch 144Hz OLED display, a large 4,500mAh battery, wireless charging, and a 50MP main camera. The new [2024 Moto Edge](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-motorola-edge-gen-5%2Fp) retains the screen and camera array of its predecessor, but it makes the leap to a 5,000mAh battery and includes a more powerful Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 processor. Interestingly, it also costs $50 less than the 2023 model.

 However, the standout feature of the revised Moto Edge (at least in my eyes) is its customizable Quick Button. This isn't all that different from the Action Button that Apple is using [in its latest iPhones](https://youtube-lab.techidaily.com/banish-stutter-and-freeze-optimize-your-outriders-gameplay/). You can program the Quick Button to launch apps or perform actions, such as opening your camera. You can also set up custom per-app actions with the Quick Button, kind of like a keyboard shortcut on a desktop computer.

Motorola

 If you need a mid-range device with a compelling spec sheet, the 2024 Moto Edge is certainly an option. It has a larger screen and a longer battery life than similarly-priced options like the [Samsung Galaxy S23 FE](https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/foremost-companies-pioneering-vr-technology-for-2024/).

 However, the use of a Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 chipset is disappointing in a phone of this price (a Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 would be more appropriate). And Motorola tends to provide middling software support for its products—the 2024 Moto Edge may not receive the frequent security or OS upgrades that we see in Samsung or Google devices.

 It's hard to recommend the 2024 Moto Edge at full price. The good news is that this phone will probably be featured in carrier deals. If you wait a few months, you be able to score the new Moto Edge at a discount.

 You can register to [pre-order the 2024 Moto Edge](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.motorola.com%2Fus%2Fsmartphones-motorola-edge-gen-5%2Fp) at the Motorola web store. The phone officially launches on June 20th and will be available at third-party retailers on that date.
