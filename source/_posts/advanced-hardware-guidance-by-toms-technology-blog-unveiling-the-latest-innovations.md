## Dropped to a Bargain - The Elite Five-Star Fractal Design North PC Chassis for Only $109

The[best PC cases](https://tools.techidaily.com) are one of those components that can sometimes last multiple builds as you swap in and out bits of hardware. I still have an old Antec 900 from many moons ago that houses an ancient Minecraft server. The fans still work, but the USB ports are all Gen 1, so it's well behind the curve.

 Today's deal focuses on one of our favorite PC cases - the Fractal Design North. When we had this case for review, it impressed our reviewer so much that it was awarded 5 stars and an Editor's Choice award for both its performance and its stunning looks, a combination of wood and metal with a kind of 70's aesthetic that would let this case not look out of place in the living room.

 Pick up the[Fractal Design North ATX mid-tower case for $109 at Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45723&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FFractal-Design-North-Slate-Gray%2Fdp%2FB09V878FXQ%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dtomshardware-us-6245994441070752999-20) \- its lowest-ever recorded price on the Camelizer. Usually retailing for $139 it's a saving of $30, a great price for such a beautiful case. Mixing both looks and performance, the Fractal Design North merges a high-airflow designed case with a mesh front panel with a Walnut wood finish, that allows cool air into the PC while still keeping a unique design that makes you want to display your PC and not hide it under a desk.
