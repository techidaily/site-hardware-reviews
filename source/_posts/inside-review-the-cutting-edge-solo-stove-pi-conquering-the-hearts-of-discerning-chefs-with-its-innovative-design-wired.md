Govee

Govee's Permanent Outdoor Lights are already a [popular smart light string](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FGovee-Permanent-Waterproof-Lighting-Assistant%2Fdp%2FB0BCQ926C1%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cbad7e054-1481-415d-88cf-0a4346045649%7Cdtp&dtb=1) because they solve a big problem for many homeowners. You can leave them up all year and not worry about them becoming damaged by the elements. Now, the smart home device manufacturer is launching a second generation of these lights, the Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights 2.

The latest Permanent Outdoor Lights feature enhanced overall performance, with Govee increasing the brightness by up to 55%, improving the lights' reliability, and adding Matter support. Govee also says it added white lights for daily use and security, though the Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 are still the same price as the previous model.

Setting up the Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 on your home's exterior means you won't have to worry about climbing a ladder to set up holiday lights in the middle of winter anymore. These lights can go up now and stay put year-round, easily transitioning from holiday lights to setting the mood for a graduation party, Fourth of July barbecue, or themed birthday party.

If you'd like to go full [Clark Griswold](https://vacation.fandom.com/wiki/Clark%5FGriswold) with your holiday lights, you'll be glad to learn that you can create synchronized displays with a single tap and use Music Sync to have your lights dance to music. You can also use AI to generate effects by giving a single prompt in the Govee app for what you want to see. 

Of course, these outdoor lights can also be set up for daily use, with over 100 preset effects for different occasions on the Govee app. 

Govee

For longevity, the Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights 2 can deliver up to 50,000 hours of reliable performance -- that's almost six years of continuous use. The lights can operate in temperatures of -4°F to 140°F, are made of UV-resistant material to withstand sun exposure without fading, and are rated IP67 for waterproof resistance.

Installing permanent light strings is easy, though it can be tedious. These Govee lights include 3M backing and clips to make installation more convenient, and the strings are available in three sizes: 50, 100, and 150 feet long.
