## Effortless Steps: Removing Repeated Data From Your Android Device

Running out of storage space can make your Android phone feel old. An easy way to [clear out some space](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/how-to-mirror-your-samsung-galaxy-s23plus-screen-to-pc-with-chromecast-drfone-by-drfone-android/) is to remove duplicate files, but that can be a pain. We'll show you an easy way to do it.

 Storage on Android can be a bit of a mess, so it's no surprise that duplicate files can build up without your knowledge. Scrolling through a long list of files and trying to pick out the duplicates manually is not fun. Thankfully, the "Files by Google" app can help.

 Files by Android is pre-installed on some Android devices. If it's not on yours, you can download it from the [Google Play Store](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU206512/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.nbu.files).

![Install &quot;Files by Google.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/install.png?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 The first time you open the app you'll be asked to agree to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Tap "Continue" to proceed if you agree.

![Tap &quot;Continue&quot; to agree to Google's terms and privacy policy.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/a.png) 

 Give the app permission to access your files by tapping "Allow" in the permissions popup.

![Tap &quot;Allow&quot; to give Google access to your files.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/b.png) 

 Now with all that out of the way we can get started. First, switch over to the "Clean" tab in the bottom bar.

![Go to the "Clean" tab.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-22_10-50-29.jpg) 

 Give the app a second or two to load everything. You should see a "Delete Duplicates" card somewhere on this screen. Tap "Select Files" to go into it.

![Tap "Select Files" on the "Delete Duplicates" card.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-22_10-52-20.jpg) 

 Again, you may need to give the app a second to load the files. Now you'll see all of the duplicate files listed side-by-side with the original file labeled. You can tap "All Duplicates" to keep the original and remove all the duplicates or go through and manually select the files.

![Select all or manually select files.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-22_10-59-18.jpg) 

 After you've made your selections tap the "Move Files to Trash" button at the bottom of the screen.

![Tap "Move Files to Trash."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-22_11-00-10.jpg) 

 Tap "Move Files to Trash" again to confirm.

![Tap "Move Files to Trash" again.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2022-03-22_11-01-01.jpg) 

 That's it! The files will be moved to the trash and permanently deleted after 30 days.
