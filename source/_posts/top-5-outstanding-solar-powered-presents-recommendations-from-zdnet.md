## **The best solar gift ideas for the holidays**

Below are the 5 best solar gift ideas I found for the holiday season this year. 

[Solight Solarpuff lantern For anyone who likes innovative lighting solutions](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB01IKMA4LO%3FlinkCode%3Dogi%26th%3D1%26psc%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cfd11a40c-a783-4f4b-ba6e-5dc3a517cd1a%7Cdtp&dtb=1) 

Solight

Pros & Cons 

**Pros** 
* Inflatable
* Stunning design
* Dustproof and waterproof

**Cons** 
* Cannot charge devices

More Details 

* **Price:** $30
* **Features:** Self-inflating | Runtime of 12 hours | 90 Lumens

There are many reasons to consider gifting a Solight Solarpuff lantern. It's versatile, for one. It makes a perfect gift for someone who enjoys spending time outdoors and who relishes using clean forms of energy. The solar lantern charges easily, and thanks to no-heat LEDs, it can be used safely inside tents, too. The solar lantern is made of nearly indestructible sailcloth, so it's dust-proof and waterproof up to two meters (six feet) for 30 minutes. It's also self-inflating, completely collapsible, and capable of emitting 90 Lumens. 

The stunning product is actually displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, so it can also bring instant style to your backyard or pool area. To provide some context: Solarpuff was designed by Alice Min Soo Chun, who was inspired by origami shapes that her Korean mother taught her to create as a child. Alice originally distributed prototypes in Haiti to aid victims of a devastating earthquake, and today 10% of sales are donated towards global poverty reduction programs.

**Pros** 
* Includes a power bank and flashlight

**Cons** 
* Solar charging takes time

More Details 

* **Price**: $60
* **Features:** 60 hour battery life | IPX6 waterproof rating | 5,000 mAh battery

A standout among solar-chargeable bluetooth speakers, Abfoce's solidly built unit is a perfect gift for anyone who likes to listen to music by the pool or beach. With an IPX6 certificate, this speaker can handle robust splashes of rain and gusts of dust without falling apart. Its 5,000 mAh battery means the speaker can pump out tunes for 60 long hours. Plus, the mono-crystalline silicon solar panel will continue to charge the system while it plays.

However, the solar charging process is a more of a trickle, so you should charge the speaker fully before use, employing the solar panel as a way to top off. Equipped with an integrated power bank, a flashlight, and an overall quality stereo, this reasonably-priced speaker is sure to keep toes tapping and heads nodding in approval throughout the holidays and beyond.

Anyone who ventures into the wild for more than a few days will worry about charging their digital devices, including headlamps, cameras, power banks and phones. Plus, batteries are a pain to haul around -- not mention that they're pollutants.

Enter BigBlue, a 28W solar charger with four panels that can hang from a backpack while you're on the move. It may not be the lightest one around, but it's by far the most dependable.

And apparently, it can charge even on a gloomy winter's day.

Adidas says a fully-charged pair will give you 80 hours of blissful high-quality sound. If you place them in a sunlight area (in or outside), you'll never ever have to worry about how much battery you have left. Plus, nearly 90% of the plastic is made from recycled material, which any eco-conscious audiophile is bound to appreciate.

## How did we choose these solar gift ideas?

We looked for solar products that meet the following criteria: 

1. The solar solution must be genuinely useful.
2. The product itself must be one of the top performers in its category.
3. It must be hardy in terms of build quality and highly regarded by reputed gear testers and consumers alike.
4. It must be fairly priced for the solution offered.

## Why should we use solar products?

As you are probably aware, the earth's climate has been steadily warming to the point where catastrophes such as wildfires, devastating floods, and severe storms are becoming increasingly common. There is widespread agreement that it is no longer feasible to depend on fossil fuels as a source of energy. This includes other products such as non-rechargeable batteries that have large carbon footprints, that are expensive, that drain fast, and that pollute the environment. Solar power however harnesses the energy from the sun and is considered "clean."

## What makes solar products stand out?

One word: Convenience. Thanks to constantly improving technology, there are numerous products being reconfigured to have solar film and small panels integrated unobtrusively into their design. This allows them to charge on the fly, so you never have to worry about running out of juice as you trek, shuttle between meetings. or travel to another destination.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## How many kinds of solar panels are there?

There are three main types of solar panels commonly manufactured right now. Monocrystalline solar panels are moderately expensive and made of pure silicon, which has the largest efficiency (24.4%). Polycrystalline panels are cheaper and have 20% efficiency. Thin film is the most expensive and the least efficient at 18.9%, but it allows for more flexible applications. New technologies like Swedish-made Powerfoyle, which prints a silicone-free, non-toxic, and flexible panel will allow more innovative solar products and solutions to enter the marketplace.
