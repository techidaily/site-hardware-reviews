Laptops with the best battery life are often built for home, office, or school use, though it is possible to find gaming laptops with decent battery lives as well; though they won't be nearly as impressive. Many laptops touting long-lasting batteries can give you anywhere between 10 and 12 hours of use on a full charge, which is great for getting through school or work on the weekdays as well as streaming media on the weekends. 

If you're willing to spend a bit more, there are laptops like the Acer Swift 3X that claim to be able to give you almost 18 hours of use. Even [budget-friendly](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-cheap-laptop/) options like the Samsung Chromebook 4+ yield up to 10 or 11 hours of battery life when fully charged, giving you a great laptop without breaking the bank. 

I've rounded up five laptops with some of the best battery lives available, and other notable features, to help you decide which one aligns with your needs.

The previous generation Ryzen edition of the Dell G15 made our list of [best cheap gaming laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-budget-gaming-laptop/), and this new iteration of the G15 (while a bit more pricey) is still one of the best gaming laptops available.

The Acer Swift 3X isn't exactly a "budget" laptop, but it is one of the more affordable on this list and available overall. And even though it has a more budget-friendly price, that doesn't mean that it has skimped out on features and components. It's built with an 11th gen Intel Core i7 processor, integrated Intel Iris Xe Max graphics, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD for plenty of power, memory, and storage for work projects, browsing the web, and streaming movies, shows, and music. Acer claims that the Swift 3X's battery can give you an astounding 17.5 hours of use on a full charge, but [our testing](https://www.zdnet.com/product/acer-swift-3x-sf314-510g-767y-14-core-i7-1165g7-16-gb-ram-1-024-tb-ssd-us-international/) got us closer to 14 hours; which is still very, very impressive.

It also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth for faster wireless internet speeds and wireless peripheral connections so you can stay up-to-date with work, in contact with friends and family, and up-to-speed on the latest Netflix and Prime Video releases.

## What is the best battery life laptop?

The best battery life laptop is the Lenovo Yoga 9i since its 2-in-1 form factor gives you the best of both a tablet and a traditional laptop while giving you a battery life of 15 hours. 

| **Laptop**            | **Price** | **Battery life** | **CPU**              |
| --------------------- | --------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Lenovo Yoga 91        | $1430     | 15 hours         | Intel Evo i7-1185G7  |
| HP Spectre x360       | $1141     | 11.5 hours       | Intel Core i7-10750H |
| Samsung Chromebook 4+ | $196      | 10.5 hours       | Intel Celeron N4000  |
| Dell G15              | $1100     | 10 hours         | Intel Core i7-12700H |
| Acer Swift 3X         | $1043     | 14 hours         | Intel Core i7-1165G7 |

## Which laptop is right for you?

Once you've hammered out a budget for a new laptop, you then need to figure out how long you will need the battery to last once it's unplugged. For students and mobile professionals, you'll want to err on the side of caution, opting for models with longer battery lives than what you actually need; just in case classes or work runs long and you can't get to a wall outlet right away. Gamers looking for a new laptop need to temper their expectations on battery life and go into the shopping process knowing that the absolute most you'll get out of a full charge while playing games is 3 to 4 hours, but the average is closer to just 2 hours. However, gaming laptops can have much longer battery lives when used for things like browsing the web and streaming media. 

| **Choose this laptop...** | **If you want...**                                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Lenovo Yoga 9i            | The best overall option                                |
| HP Spectre x360           | A 4K display with 11.5 hours of battery life           |
| Samsung Chromebook        | A long-lasting laptop for classwork                    |
| Dell G15                  | A gaming laptop                                        |
| Acer Swift 3X             | A laptop with 14 hours of battery life for under $1000 |

## How did we choose these laptops?

Aside from price and battery life, I tried to choose a variety of laptops to suit different work and entertainment needs. I chose models from brands like HP, Dell, Samsung, and Acer because they tend to be not only affordable, but reliable as well.

## How many hours of battery life is good for a laptop?

It all depends on what you're going to use the laptop for. Gaming laptops are considered to have "excellent" battery lives when you can get 3 or 4 hours out of them while playing games. For laptops intended for home, school, or office work, it's reasonable to expect your battery to last between 8 and 10 hours. Though it is possible to find models with significantly longer battery lives, which are great if you want to use your laptop while on a business flight or watch a movie in bed.

## Can I use my laptop while it's charging?

Absolutely! You can do everything on a laptop while it's charging that you can when it's unplugged. My advice would be to not leave it plugged in after the battery reaches full charge, since this can actually damage the battery and lead to a diminished battery life.

## How to improve laptop battery life?

If you want to get more use out of a battery charge or extend your laptop's standby time, you can take a variety of steps to do so. One of the quickest and easiest is to simply reduce your screen's brightness; by reducing screen brightness, it won't draw as much power and extend your battery's life. You can also enable a power save mode, which automatically disables unused ports and programs to reduce power consumption. Or you can keep your laptop's operating temperatures lower with a [cooling pad](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop-cooling-pad/). By improving airflow and waste heat dissipation, your laptop won't have to work as hard to run programs, further improving battery life.
