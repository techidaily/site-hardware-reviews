 Are you wondering what your Android build number is? Sometimes, knowing the Android build number of your device helps you make better decisions on your phone when troubleshooting or downloading apps. Stay with us to know what the Android build number is and how to find it on your device.

##  What Is the Android Build Number?

 The build number gives more information on the specific version of Android on your device. Android releases are just numbers like 11, 12, 13, etc, but Android _build numbers_, on the other hand, are more complex identifiers. They consist of numbers and letters (for example, **RPQ1.231001.001**) that tell you more about the software. Let's break down what each section means.

* **R** is the first letter of the build number and represents the Android version's code name. In this case, R stands for Red Velvet Cake, the code name for Android 11.
* **P** stands for the supported vertical. The letter P usually represents the primary platform branch or the first release.
* **Q1** is an alphanumeric code that is used to identify the code branch the build was made from.
* **231001** refers to the date the build was created. It is written in the YYMMDD format. So this means the build was created on the first of October 2023.
* **001** is used to identify the version of the build.
* At the end of the build number, there is sometimes an alphanumeric code that shows the hotfix on top of the build.

##  Why Should You Know Your Android Build Number

 Knowing your Android build version helps you determine if your Android device is running the latest version or if an update is available. It helps you confirm if your phone has all the latest security patches released. These patches address vulnerabilities and enhance the overall security of your phone.

 The Android build number also helps you get accurate solutions tailored to your device when troubleshooting or seeking help from customer support. Knowing which apps are compatible with your device before downloading or using them is another good reason to know the build number.
