I spend quite a bit of time with my laptop out and about, at places where there are other people. And no matter where I go, I can't help but notice other people trying to sneak a peek at my screen. I can hardly blame them; after all, we've become so conditioned to looking at screens.

Short of typing "stop looking at my screen" in a huge font size, a less passive-aggressive alternative is to add a privacy screen, and I've finally found a privacy screen that I'm happy with – the [StarTech.com MacBook Pro double-sided gold privacy filter with enhanced privacy](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FStarTech-com-MacBook-Double-Sided-Enhanced-Security%2Fdp%2FB0CPPZKW6W%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cbdb5781e-52bf-4fa7-a90e-5f66ee9486a5%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

I get a bit apprehensive before installing any kind of screen protector or filter, as I've had so many bad experiences -- from getting adhesive stuck to my hand, to trapping huge chunks of debris between the screen and the film I'm applying. 

This kit is easy to install and comes with everything you need. There's a microfiber cloth for cleaning the screen, and transparent, residue-free adhesive strips for affixing the filter to the screen. Oh, and there's the filter itself.

The installation took only a few minutes, and I'm pleased with how easy it was and how well it fits. Even the cutout for the camera and sensors at the top of the display are perfect.

I'm thrilled with the added privacy this screen offers. 

While sitting in front of the screen, I don't notice it. (I have had to set the display a little brighter than normal.) But when I shift to the side, the screen goes from bright to dark. Even sitting in a seat right next to the laptop, it's hard to see what's being displayed. 

It really works!

Note that this filter does alter the brightness and color calibration of your display. Therefore, if you're engaged in tasks like photo and video editing, this isn't suitable for you. However, if you're day consists of primarily working on emails, word processor documents, or spreadsheets, and you wish to prevent casual snooping of what's on your screen, this is an ideal solution.
