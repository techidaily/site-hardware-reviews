### Key Takeaways

 In the Google Messages app, go to a conversation and select "Details" from the menu. You can block the number and report it as spam.

 For the Samsung Messages app, go to a conversation and select Information > Menu > Block Contact.

 Look, we all get annoying text messages ([SMS](https://network-issues.techidaily.com/nvidia-patch-rtx210-win11-driver-update/)) from time to time. Maybe it's spam, maybe it's from someone you don't want to talk to. Whatever the case may be, you can block text messages on your Android phone.

 Of course, as with all things Android, there are various ways to do things. In the case of blocking text messages, it depends on which texting app you use. We'll cover the two most common apps here: Google's [Messages](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU216431/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging) app and Samsung's [Messages](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgalaxystore.samsung.com%2Fprepost%2F000005857133%3Famp%3D%26appId%3Dcom.samsung.android.messaging%26session%255Fid%3DW%255F4090429045295c3bd1c7675705b3a3e9) app.

##  How to Block Texts on Android

 Blocking texts with Google's [Messages](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU216431/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging) app can be done from the conversation by going to the "Details" screen. First, open the app and select a conversation of the number you'd like to block.

##  How to Unblock Text Messages on Android

 Unblocking a number is typically the same process as blocking, and some messaging apps have a dedicated section for blocked numbers.

 In Google's Messages app, open the hamburger menu and go to Spam & Blocked > three-dot menu > Blocked Numbers. Tap the "X" next to a number to unblock it.

##  How to Block Calls on Android

[Blocking calls on Android](https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/steps-to-troubleshoot-unresponsive-hp-print-subsystems/) is largely the same as blocking text messages, but it happens through the phone app instead of the messaging app. When you block someone's text messages, you are also blocking them from calling you.

 With the Phone by Google app, you can go to the "Call History" section and select a contact. Tap the "Block/Report Spam" option.

![Select a call and then tap &quot;Block/Report Spam.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-28_16-45-52.jpg?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1)

 In Samsung's default Phone app, go to Settings > Block Numbers and enter a number or choose from the recent calls.
