### Key Takeaways

 In the Google Messages app, go to a conversation and select "Details" from the menu. You can block the number and report it as spam.

 For the Samsung Messages app, go to a conversation and select Information > Menu > Block Contact.

 Look, we all get annoying text messages ([SMS](https://network-issues.techidaily.com/nvidia-patch-rtx210-win11-driver-update/)) from time to time. Maybe it's spam, maybe it's from someone you don't want to talk to. Whatever the case may be, you can block text messages on your Android phone.

 Of course, as with all things Android, there are various ways to do things. In the case of blocking text messages, it depends on which texting app you use. We'll cover the two most common apps here: Google's [Messages](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU216431/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging) app and Samsung's [Messages](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgalaxystore.samsung.com%2Fprepost%2F000005857133%3Famp%3D%26appId%3Dcom.samsung.android.messaging%26session%255Fid%3DW%255F4090429045295c3bd1c7675705b3a3e9) app.

##  How to Block Texts on Android

 Blocking texts with Google's [Messages](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU216431/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.messaging) app can be done from the conversation by going to the "Details" screen. First, open the app and select a conversation of the number you'd like to block.

![Select a conversation.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2023-03-15_16-26-13.jpg) 

 Next, tap the three-dot menu icon in the top right and select "Details."

![Tap the menu icon and choose "Details."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2023-03-15_16-27-00.jpg)

![Tap "Block and Report Spam."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2023-03-15_16-28-11.jpg) 

 A pop-up will appear with an option to report the number for spam along with blocking. To only block the number, uncheck the box and tap "OK."

 That's all there is to it! You will no longer receive text messages or phone calls from the number.

##  How to Block Text Messages on Samsung Galaxy Phones

 To block text messages on a Samsung Galaxy phone, go to the "Information" screen for a conversation in the "Messages" app. First, select a conversation.

![Select "Block Contact."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2023-03-16_11-31-38.jpg) 

 Confirm your decision by selecting "Block" from the pop-up menu.

![Tap "Block."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/2023-03-16_11-32-29.jpg) 

 Done! You won't receive text messages or phone calls from the contact anymore.

##  How to Unblock Text Messages on Android

 Unblocking a number is typically the same process as blocking, and some messaging apps have a dedicated section for blocked numbers.

 In Google's Messages app, open the hamburger menu and go to Spam & Blocked > three-dot menu > Blocked Numbers. Tap the "X" next to a number to unblock it.

![Tap the X to unblock a number.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2023-03-15_14-24-47.jpg) 

 In the Samsung Message's app, go to Settings > Block Numbers and Spam > Block Numbers and tap the minus icon next to a number you'd like to unblock.

![Tap the minus icon to unblock a number.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/2023-03-15_14-24-31.jpg) 

 Simple as that! You will now be able to receive text messages (and calls) from the number.

##  How to Block Calls on Android

[Blocking calls on Android](https://printer-issues.techidaily.com/steps-to-troubleshoot-unresponsive-hp-print-subsystems/) is largely the same as blocking text messages, but it happens through the phone app instead of the messaging app. When you block someone's text messages, you are also blocking them from calling you.

 With the Phone by Google app, you can go to the "Call History" section and select a contact. Tap the "Block/Report Spam" option.

![Select a call and then tap &quot;Block/Report Spam.&quot;](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-28_16-45-52.jpg?trim=1,1&amp;bg-color=000&amp;pad=1,1) 

 In Samsung's default Phone app, go to Settings > Block Numbers and enter a number or choose from the recent calls.
