## Wake Up Gently with Philips Hue - Transform Your Mornings Into Breathtaking Sunrises by Your Bedside

Philips Hue is now offering the Twilight bedside lamp, a smart lighting device that simulates a sunrise and sunlight effect as you fall asleep and wake up.

 The [Twilight lamp](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003691/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/sleep-and-wake-up-light-twilight-sleep-and-wake-up-light-white/046677585600) contains two smart LED lighting elements—one that points downward (like a reading lamp) and another that runs alongside the lamp's backside to shine light on the wall. Each of these light sources can be controlled independently. However, Philips Hue explains that the wall-facing light, which can produce a full range of colors, is meant to create a "sunrise" or "sunset" effect.

 The lamp's primary lighting element is limited to conventional "warm" and "cool" shades of white and simply replaces your typical bedside lamp (although it can get a lot dimmer than most lamps and effectively doubles as a nightlight). To that end, Philips Hue provides several nature-inspired lighting themes that you can trigger at sunrise or bedtime. And you're free to customize the lamp's actions in the Philips Hue app.

 My favorite part of this lamp is its built-in buttons. Instead of fooling around with an app or a voice command every night, you can press a button the top of the Twilight lamp to begin your bedtime routine. Additional buttons on the Twilight lamp allow you to control other smart devices around your home, so it's kind of like having a [Hue Smart Button](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003691/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-smart-button/046677553715) at your bedside.

 Along with the new Twilight Lamp, Philips Hue has launched four [new bulb shapes](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003691/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/all-products?page=1&sort=newest) for [Lightguide pendant cord lamps](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003691/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/bulb-black-pendant-cord/046677577551)—small globe, large globe, triangle, and Edison. The company is also offering new [Solo Lightstrips](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003691/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/lightstrips-solo-lightstrip-33-feet/046677589936) in various sizes. I should note that Twilight is the first Philips Hue smart light to be explicitly marketed as a "wake-up" or "bedside" light. Previous products like the [Hue Go](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-7602031-Bluetooth-Zigbee/dp/B07Z8CNCLN/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fphilips-hue-twilight-lam-debut%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) and [Hue Bloom](https://www.amazon.com/Philips-Hue-560185-Bloom-Portables/dp/B08CK1L7BZ/?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2003691&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fphilips-hue-twilight-lam-debut%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term) are often used as bedside lamps, but they aren't explicitly marketed for that purpose.

 The new [Philips Hue Twilight lamp](https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/3607085/type/dlg/sid/UUhtgUeUpU2003691/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/sleep-and-wake-up-light-twilight-sleep-and-wake-up-light-black/046677585631) is available for $280\. It comes in black and white colorways. You can purchase the Twilight lamp from the Philips Hue website, and it should arrive at other retailers in the coming days or weeks.
