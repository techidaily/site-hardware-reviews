 There's no denying that phones have gotten big, sometimes comically so. It can be nearly impossible to use a modern Android phone with one hand. That's where "One-Handed Mode" comes in, and many Android phones have it.

##  What is One-Handed Mode?

 If you're unfamiliar with "[One-Handed Mode](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-customize-screenshot-storing-on-mac-for-2024/)," it's simply a feature that shifts the UI to make things easier to reach. On some phones, this means sliding the contents of the display down to the bottom half of the screen. Some devices also allow you to shrink the entire display down to a corner of the screen. This isn't a permanent thing, but it's handy in certain situations. 

 For this guide, we'll show you how One-Handed Mode works on Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel phones.

##  One-Handed Mode for Samsung Galaxy Phones

 With a [Samsung Galaxy phone](https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-trendsetting-techniques-going-viral-in-the-digital-world/), swipe down once from the top of the screen and tap the gear icon.

 Next, you can choose how One-Handed Mode is activated. If you're using gesture navigation, you can only choose "Gesture." But if you use the three-button layout, you also have the option to double-tap the home button.

 In One-Handed Mode, you can tap the arrow icon to move the shrunken screen to the left or right. You can also grab the corner to resize the screen. Tap on any empty screen space to exit.
