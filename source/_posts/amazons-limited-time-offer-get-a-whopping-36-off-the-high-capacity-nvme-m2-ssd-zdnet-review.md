First, it's unique. It is a 15.6-inch widescreen 2-in-1, which is still fairly uncommon. (Its competition includes models like [Lenovo Yoga 7i](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovo-yoga-slim-7i-pro-14-inch-review/) and Dell Inspiron 15 2-in-1.) Second, the laptop is 40% off, but the deal ends Saturday night. You have until the end of the day on Nov. 26 to cash out.
