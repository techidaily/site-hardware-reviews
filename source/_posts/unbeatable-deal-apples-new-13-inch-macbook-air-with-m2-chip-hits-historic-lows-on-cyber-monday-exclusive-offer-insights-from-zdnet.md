MacBook Air

The MacBook Air (M1, 2020) may not be the [latest and greatest](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-macbook-air-m2-2022-review/?ftag=TRE-03-10aaa6b&bhid=%7B%24external%5Fid%7D&mid=%7B%24MESSAGE%5FID%7D&cid=%7B%24contact%5Fid%7D) from Apple, but it remains one of the most reliable and efficient laptops that money can buy for under $1,000\. It's also one of the lightest. 

During Amazon's Prime Early Access Sale -- otherwise known as 'Prime Day 2' -- the [M1 MacBook sees a massive $200 price cut](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FApple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage%2Fdp%2FB08N5KWB9H%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cafe8be21-9ac1-4445-aad8-e9d96d91f4d5%7Cdtp&dtb=1), dropping the initial asking price down to just $799\. That's the lowest price we've seen for the two-year-old device, beating its previous Black Friday, Prime Day, and holiday deals.

Had the pandemic not forced me to stay home, I probably would've snagged the MacBook Air M1 two years ago. It was one of the first devices to feature Apple's M1 chipset, and [benchmark tests proved](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-m1-speed-tests-new-arm-macbook-air-blows-away-intel-based-macbook-pro/) that the lightweight MacBook could throw down against heavyweight, Intel-based computers -- including Apple's own MacBook Pro. For such a huge gap in performance, speed, and efficiency, it was hard to believe that Apple was selling the laptop for just $999\.

All three colors fall under the $200 discount, and if you're not a fan of the notched display on the newer MacBooks, you'll be well off with any version of the 2020 MacBook Air.
