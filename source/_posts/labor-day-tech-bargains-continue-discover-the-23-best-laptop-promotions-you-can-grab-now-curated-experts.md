## Labor Day Tech Bargains Continue! Discover the 23 Best Laptop Promotions You Can Grab Now - Curated  Experts

[Labor Day](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-labor-day-deals-2024/) is a big deal in the laptop industry. Retailers need to reduce the stock of products that came out earlier in the year to make room for new launches during the fall. That's great news for you, since it means big sales on new laptops that were just released. Retailers like [Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cb020a9e2-b5dd-42f9-924b-9779024bb819%7Cdtp&dtb=1), [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2F&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp), [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), and more are offering excellent deals during the holiday.

Samsung's Galaxy Book 4 Edge is one of the first line of Copilot+ PCs that launched with the cutting-edge Snapdragon X Elite processors earlier this year. The AI-powered chip gives this laptop impressive battery life, especially for a 16-inch AMOLED display. But its overall performance is snappy and robust, great for power users and multitaskers -- especially if you have other Samsung products.

We went hands-on with this 16-inch laptop earlier this year, and it's nothing short of powerful. Under the hood, you'll find an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU, and 32GB of memory, ensuring load times are almost nonexistent. This hardware configuration is perfect for demanding workflows at the office, but even allows the IdeaPad Pro 5i to act as a capable gaming laptop.

The first thing you notice about Samsung's Galaxy Book 4 Ultra is the gorgeous display. You can't ask for much better than the 16-inch, 3K AMOLED screen with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate and 400 nits of brightness. There's more to it than just the display, though. Its Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 graphics card and up to 1TB of storage pairs nicely with a massive 76Wh battery for a high-powered, versatile laptop.

### When do Labor Day sales begin in 2024?

Labor Day is Monday, September 2nd, 2024, but many products will go on sale before that date. However, we can't guarantee that these laptops will stay at their sales prices after the holiday has passed. 

### Are laptops really cheaper during Labor Day sales?

Absolutely. Some of the markdowns on these laptops are the lowest we've ever seen. Labor Day holds a unique position in the calendar year because it's after all the product launches of the first half of the year, yet before the huge ramp-up in sales for the holidays. 

### When is the cheapest time of year to buy a laptop?

Labor Day and back-to-school season are typically some of the best times a year to find laptop deals, so if you see a good one, we'd recommend jumping on it. However, if you can wait another few months, Black Friday is sure to see some of the best laptop deals of the year as well.

### What is the best 2-in-1 laptop for Labor Day?

There are a few excellent 2-in-1 laptops on sale for Labor Day, including one of our most recommended picks: The [HP Envy X360](https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-9041660-15850793?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-2-in-1-laptop-16-ad0097nr&sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), which you can find for 25% off. In [my review](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ive-tested-dozens-of-2-in-1-laptops-this-one-hits-all-the-right-marks/), I said that this 16-inch 2-in-1 has "all the features that consumers actually want in a convertible: a gorgeous display, beefy speakers, and a suite of hardware to back it up, resulting in solid performance and a satisfying media experience at a mid-range price point." You can also find deals on the [Galaxy Book 4 Pro 360](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fgalaxy-book4-series%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-book4-pro-360-16-intel-core-ultra-7-1tb-moonstone-gray-np960qgk-kg1us%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) and the [Lenovo Yoga 7i 2-in-1](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-i7-1355U-Touch-Screen-Laptop16GB-82YN0002US%2Fdp%2FB0CK3ZK7WT%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cb020a9e2-b5dd-42f9-924b-9779024bb819%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

### How did we choose these Labor Day deals?

ZDNET only writes about laptops that we actually think are good deals. We've gone hands-on with quite a few of these exact products this year, and if we haven't, we're at least familiar with the line of laptops they come from and their predecessors. Typically, we look for deals that are at least 20% off (or are hardly ever on sale), using established price comparison tools and trackers to determine whether the deal is actually on sale and how frequently it drops. 

We also looked over customer reviews to find out what matters to real people who already own and use the deals we're recommending. Our recommendations may also be based on our own testing -- in addition to extensive research and comparison shopping. The goal is to deliver the most accurate advice to help you shop smarter. 

### When will these deals expire?

Deals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings. Our team of experts regularly checks in on the deals we share to ensure they are still live and obtainable. We're sorry if you've missed out on this deal, but don't fret -- we're constantly finding new chances to save and sharing them with you at [ZDNET.com](https://www.zdnet.com/).
