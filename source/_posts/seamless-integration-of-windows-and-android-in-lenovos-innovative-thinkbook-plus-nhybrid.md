## Seamless Integration of Windows & Android in Lenovo's Innovative ThinkBook Plus Nhybrid.

We're all familiar with 2-in-1 laptops and know what to expect from these convertible devices. At CES 2024, Lenovo delivered a wildly different hybrid you'll want to see. Its new ThinkBook Plus 5 runs Windows 11 and Android, giving you the best of both worlds.

 Most manufacturers think of Windows 2-in-1 as the ultimate productivity machine, but we all know that Windows 11 works best as a laptop, not a tablet. That's why with Lenovo's crazy new hybrid, the bottom packs everything you need for a capable Windows 11 computing experience, while in the top half (behind the stunning display), you'll find all the Android bits.

 In laptop mode, the experience is similar to any other clamshell. The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus 5 Hybrid packs a powerful Intel Core Ultra 7 and Intel Arc GPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, a 1TB SSD, all-day battery life, Harmon Kardon speakers, USB-C, a fingerprint reader, etc. Everything you want and need from a laptop.

 However, Android comes to life once you yank the impressive 14-inch 2.8K OLED display from the keyboard dock. Up top and inside the display is an Android-friendly Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1 processor, 12GB of RAM, another 256GB of internal storage, and more. The tablet has another USB-C port, front and rear cameras, four little 1W speakers, and a 38 Whr battery.

 Essentially, it's a fully-featured standalone Android 13 tablet. However, when you want to build a presentation or be more productive, snap it into the keyboard that houses all the Windows 11 goods and get to work.

 This might be one of the craziest devices we've seen at CES this year. It's worth noting that, at least right now, the two operating systems don't play nicely together. By that, I mean you can't work on a project or program in Windows 11, then yank off the screen and continue working from Android while sitting on the patio or a plane. They are two entirely separate systems. However, there is a hybrid folder that will automatically sync files you need to both devices.

 These days, there are plenty of [great 2-in-1 laptops](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/solving-the-reset-failed-there-was-an-error-message-on-windows/) to choose from. However, Lenovo says the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid should arrive in Q2 and run you about $2,000 if you want to try something unique and new.
