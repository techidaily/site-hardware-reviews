## Introducing the Next Generation: Samsung's Revolutionary Copilot+ PC with Advanced AI Capabilities, as Revealed

[IFA 2024](https://www.ifa-berlin.com/) in Berlin saw a host of new laptops with novel features, like [Lenovo's auto-rotating screens](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-went-hands-on-with-lenovos-auto-swiveling-laptop-at-ifa-2024-and-its-quite-the-spectacle/) and [phone-tapping share features](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovos-newest-laptops-have-a-clever-solution-for-iphone-file-transferring-that-you-have-to-see-for-yourself/), I was most excited to see [Samsung's Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fgalaxy-book5-series%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-book5-pro-360-16-intel-core-ultra-7-1tb-gray-np960qha-kg1us%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), the first in the Book 5 series and the newest addition to Samsung's Copilot+ PC line.

When [I reviewed](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-samsungs-new-copilot-pc-and-its-one-of-the-best-windows-laptop-deals-right-now/) the [Samsung Galaxy Book 4 Edge](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book4-edge-copilot-pc-16-amoled-touch-screen-laptop-snapdragon-x-elite-3-4ghz-16gb-memory-512gb-storage-sapphire-blue%2F6583788.p&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), I praised its gorgeous display and ultralight form factor, noting that it was one of the best-performing (and best-looking) laptops from the first batch of Copilot+ PCs, despite some buying concerns of its own. 

**Also: [5 most interesting Copilot+ laptops revealed at IFA 2024 (including one for gaming)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-most-interesting-copilot-laptops-revealed-at-ifa-2024-including-one-for-gaming/)**

The next in the lineup certainly follows suit, with some added versatility in the 2-in-1 convertible form factor and an Intel processor swapped into this model instead of the Windows-on-ARM Snapdragon X Elite on the Galaxy Book 5 Edge. 

One of the themes we saw on new laptops announced at this year's IFA was a diversification of AI features across new platforms and hardware. The Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 supports that trend with Intel's new Series 2 Core Ultra 7 processor with a 47-TOPs NPU that Samsung says powers over 300 different AI features across 100 apps, including [Google's Circle to Search](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-circle-to-search-on-android-and-what-models-support-it/), Chat Assist, and Live Translate.

I had a chance to go hands-on with the Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 on Samsung's massive show floor at IFA and it's a device that looks immediately impressive with a bright, 16-inch display and surprisingly thin and light body. 

The AMOLED WQXGA+ touch display on this is just as gorgeous as the Book 4 Edge, with 500 nits of brightness, 2880 x 1800 resolution, and a smooth 120Hz variable refresh rate. 

**Also: [Lenovo's newest laptops have a clever solution for iPhone file transferring that you have to see for yourself](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovos-newest-laptops-have-a-clever-solution-for-iphone-file-transferring-that-you-have-to-see-for-yourself/)**

Popping it into tablet mode instantly makes it the kind of device you want to watch movies on or use creatively with Samsung's S Pen, and first looks with the Intel Arc GPU made for smooth, responsive graphics. Additionally, the screen mitigated glare quite well under harsh lighting. 

I didn't get to run any games, but I'm curious to see how this Intel-powered machine handles gaming in comparison to the Snapdragon chip, and if it can run as cool, especially with its ultra-thin form factor (and with 16GB of RAM).

One of the other elements of the Galaxy Book 4 Edge was its football field-sized trackpad, which some users (me included) said was a little too unwieldy. Samsung seems to have listened to the complaints, as it added adaptive palm rejection to the touchpad in the Book 5 Pro 360\. 

I'm looking forward to getting my hands on this new machine, as it's one of the most visually striking of all the new Copilot+ PCs, but similar to its Book 4 sibling, there are likely to be some buying factors to consider with the different configurations, exclusivity with Samsung devices, and most importantly -- the price. 

The Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro 360 is [available for pre-order now for $1,700](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fgalaxy-book5-series%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-book5-pro-360-16-intel-core-ultra-7-1tb-gray-np960qha-kg1us%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), with general availability expected later in September.
