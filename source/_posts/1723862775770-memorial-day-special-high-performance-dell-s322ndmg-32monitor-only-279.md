## Score the Ultimate Bargain: $279 32” Dell S322DMG Monitor, Perfect for Gamers This Memorial Day

Right now is a great time to get your hands on one of the[best gaming monitors](https://tools.techidaily.com) on the market. As part of a Memorial Day weekend sale, you can find the[Dell S3222DGM](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-8900246-12578053%3Fsid%3Dtomshardware-us-9311511623259048210%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fdell-32-curved-gaming-monitor-s3222dgm%2Fapd%2F210-azzr%2Fmonitors-monitor-accessories) for $279, one of its best prices to date. It's worth noting that we've seen this monitor get as low as $239 during Black Friday last year so this isn't the lowest price ever. However, it's still one of the best we've seen and it's especially remarkable given that it has a recommended price of $349\. This offer is available at both[Dell](https://tools.techidaily.com) and Best Buy. Neither vendor has specified an expiration for the discount.

 We reviewed the[Dell S3222DGM](https://tools.techidaily.com) back in 2022 and were very pleased with our experience, so pleased that it made its way to our overall top pick on our list of best gaming monitors. Its large size, dense resolution and great contrast helped it stand out against the competition. All of that considered, today's discount only sweetens the deal.
