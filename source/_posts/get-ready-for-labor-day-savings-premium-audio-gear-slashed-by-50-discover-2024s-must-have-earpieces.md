If you want a pair of premium headphones that deliver impeccable sound, all-day comfort, and a sleek design, consider picking up the Sonos Ace during your Labor Day shopping. These headphones were $449 at launch, and you can get them for $399 at [Sonos](https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-9041660-15878877-1724043600000?sid=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), [Best Buy](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsonos-ace-each-black%2F6580673.p%3FskuId%3D6580673&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1), [Walmart](https://goto.walmart.com/c/5597632/565706/9383?sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSonos-Ace-Wireless-Noise-Canceling-Headphones-White%2F6309069930&subId1=zd-__COM_CLICK_ID__-dtp), and [Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CYHGPP1L%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C4429b2c2-7a60-460f-9ed7-c235ed0a1caa%7Cdtp&dtb=1).

I tested the Ace headphones when they were released in early June and enjoyed their immersive and dynamic sound, simple and intuitive design, and immense comfort. The Sonos Ace support Dolby Atmos for an enhanced movie-watching and music-listening experience. They also have a USB-C port for high-quality listening and charging.

The Ace have 30 hours of battery life, meaning they can keep up with your audio needs for a few days without needing a charge. Additionally, iOS and Android users can access all of the Ace's software features, making them a great option for people with mixed-device ecosystems.

The Sonos Ace debuted with an innovative feature called TV Audio Swap, which allows listeners to seamlessly switch audio between the Ace and their compatible Sonos soundbar. At launch, this feature was only available on iOS and only compatible with the Sonos Arc soundbar.

Since then, [Sonos has expanded compatibility to Android and the Sonos Beam and Ray soundbars](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonos-brought-tv-audio-swap-to-more-devices-heres-why-its-my-all-time-favorite-feature/), making these headphones' best feature accessible to more customers.

Those looking for a new pair of premium headphones with up-to-date features should look not further than the Sonos Ace, especially if you already own Sonos products. It's unclear how long this deal will be available, so be sure to check it out before the holiday weekend ends.
