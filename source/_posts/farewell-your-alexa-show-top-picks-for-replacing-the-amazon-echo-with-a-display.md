## Farewell Your Alexa Show: Top Picks for Replacing the Amazon Echo with a Display

Amazon has discontinued one of its Echo smart speakers. It's time to say goodbye to the fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock, released in 2022 featuring an eye-turning dot-matrix display.

 The speaker is [delisted on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B8W5FW?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004483&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fecho-dot-with-clock-discontinued%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), though you might be able to find refurbished models or purchase the device from select retailers like Target and Best Buy while supplies last. Existing speakers should continue to function and receive updates for the forseeable future.

 Amazon spokesperson Liz Roland confirmed the news by telling _The Verge_, “You can check the product page for the latest device availability, but once inventory of this generation Echo Dot with Clock is sold through it will not be restocked.” Introduced in 2022, the Echo Dot with Clock was beloved for its affordable price, compact size, and especially its dot-matrix display behind the fabric mesh cover. The dot-matric LCD screen performed exceptionally well in dimly-lit rooms and could be configured to show the time, weather, etc.

 The fifth-generation refresh of the Echo Dot with Clock dropped in September 2022 with an integrated room temperature sensor, clearer vocals, deeper bass, ultrasonic motion detection technology, a built-in eero Wi-Fi extender, and more.

 Amazon gave no reason for the discontinuation at publication time, but the writing has been on the wall for some time now. We found reports on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/1d64zbj/echo%5Fdot%5Fwith%5Fclock%5Fgone/) claiming Amazon began showing listings for refurbished Dots two months ago, suggesting the company has been clearing stock. The move begs the question: Should you get a regular Dot or wait for a new model instead?

 We don't know whether there are plans for a new Echo with a dot-matrix display, but the latest Echo Spot could easily be a spiritual successor to the discontinued Dot. First released in 2017 with a 2.5-inch circular display, the Spot was discontinued just two years later to make way for [an updated Echo Spot released ahead of the 2024 Prime Day](https://visual-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-beyond-the-screen-advanced-techniques-in-logging-virtual-reality-games/).

 Even though it's priced a bit higher at $80 in the United States, the new speaker has taken the spot of the phased-out Echo Dot with Clock. It, too, rocks a built-in alarm clock but one-ups the discontinued Dot with such perks as a larger 2.83-inch touchscreen that can be customized with six colors, physical buttons to adjust the volume and toggle the microphone, enhanced sound quality, a built-in room temperature sensor, Amazon's Voice AI, and more.

 If anecdotal reports and online forums are anything to go by, people don't seem to prefer the new Spot's LCD screen over the Dot's retro-looking dot-matrix display. Amazon's device division also [isn't doing well](https://qz.com/amazon-lost-25-billion-alexa-devices-echo-kindle-jassy-1851602188), so the Dot's removal could have to do with streamlining the smart speaker offering. If you're interested in the fifth-generation Echo Dot with Clock, act fast because some Target locations had it on clearance last week. Your best bet is refurbished or used models on Amazon and eBay.

 Amazon isn't the only company that seems unsure about its smart speaker lineup. Apple's full-size HomePod, which debuted in 2018, was abruptly discontinued in March 2021\. Two years later, [Apple unveiled the revamped second-generation model](https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/transforming-youtubers-into-titans-with-key-insights-from-the-hub/) with fewer tweeters and microphones, ultra-wideband support, a built-in Thread radio, and sensors for measuring humidity and temperature.
