## Microsoft Copilot Now on New Laptops - Browse the Best Selection of Snapdragon Elite X Machines for Immediate Purchase

Several PC manufacturers recently[launched Qualcomm-powered laptops](https://tools.techidaily.com) and many models are hitting store shelves and shipping out from today. These[Copilot+ PCs](https://tools.techidaily.com) come with Arm-based[Snapdragon X chips](https://tools.techidaily.com) featuring a 45 TOPS NPU and have new AI-powered features,[like Paintâ€™s Cocreator](https://tools.techidaily.com) , as well as access to the controversial Windows Recall feature thatâ€™s been relegated[to Windows Insiders](https://tools.techidaily.com) only.

 Although these new Copilot+ PCs are only getting a few new features to start with, other third-party apps like Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom, DaVinci Resolve Studio, CapCut, and more will use the built-in NPUs on these computers to run AI features locally. Furthermore, the efficiency of the Arm-based processors of these chips means weâ€™re finally getting Windows laptops that can compete with the legendary battery life of Apple-silicon-powered MacBooks.

 So, if youâ€™re in the market for a new Windows laptop and want to get in on the AI bandwagon, these are the Snapdragon X laptops launching today or in the next few weeks.

## Acer Swift 14 AI

 The Swift 14 AI is Acerâ€™s bet on the Copilot+ PC, and it can be had with either a Snapdragon X Plus or Snapdragon X Elite chip. It also has a 75Wh battery, which the company claims will give the laptop up to 26 hours of battery life. You can also spec it with as much as 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD.

 The XPS 13 is one of the most popular Windows laptops around, and itâ€™s one of the first[Dell](https://tools.techidaily.com) machines to get the Copilot+ PC brand.

But if you want the best image quality, the XPS 13 can be had with a 3K OLED screen. The XPS 13 starts at $1,299.99 but can quickly jump to $2,499.99 if you max out its specs.

## Microsoft Surface Laptop

![Microsoft Surface Laptop](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/C6DJ6XaHjf2BKnT2gskUhk-320-80.jpg)

 (Image credit: Microsoft)

 Of course,[Microsoft](https://tools.techidaily.com) will not lag behind the competition when it comes to Copilot+ PCs.

It also comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD.

 The more powerful Snapdragon X Elite chip-powered Surface Laptops start at $1,399.99 for the 13.8-inch version with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. Interestingly, the 15-inch model (which can only be had with a Snapdragon X Elite chip) starts at $1,299.99, but this one only has a 256GB SSD, which seems awfully small for todayâ€™s requirements. If you want to get this Copilot+ PC, the Surface Laptop is now available on[the Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/surface-laptop-7th-edition/8tq2hq5xxkj9) .

 If you prefer the tablet form factor, you can still get a Copilot+ PC with the Microsoft Surface Pro. This 2-in-1 starts at $999.99 for the Snapdragon X Plus version with a 13-inch LCD display, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD for the Platinum colorway. The three other colors â€” Sapphire, Dune, and Black â€” start at $1,199.99 with a larger 512GB SSD.

 The Snapdragon X Elite model gets a 13-inch OLED screen and 16GB of RAM, but you now also have a choice between a 512GB or a 1TB SSD. The Snapdragon X Elite Surface Pro starts at $1,499.99 but jumps to $1,699.99 for the larger storage version. You can also spec this chip with 32GB of RAM and 1TB SSD, but youâ€™ll have to shell out $2,099.99 for this model. You can get it now from[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/configure/surface-pro-11th-edition/8n9t09p96cmj) if you want a new Windows 11 tablet.

Whichever model you choose, the Galaxy Book4 Edge is now available on[the Samsung website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2Flink%3Fpublisher%255Fslug%3Dfuture%26exclusive%3D1%26u1%3Dtomshardware-us-2146102897962536993%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.samsung.com%252Fus%252Fcomputing%252Fgalaxy-books%252Fgalaxy-book4-edge%252Fbuy%252Fgalaxy-book4-edge-16-qualcomm-snapdragon-x-elite-1tb-sapphire-blue-np960xmb-kb1us%252F%26article%255Fname%3DMicrosoft%2520Copilot%252B%2520PCs%2520available%2520now%2520%25E2%2580%2594%2520here%2520are%2520all%2520the%2520Snapdragon%2520Elite%2520X%2520laptops%2520you%2520can%2520buy%2520today%2520%257C%2520Tom%27s%2520Hardware%26article%255Furl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.tomshardware.com%252Flaptops%252Fmicrosoft-copilot-pcs-available-now-here-are-all-the-snapdragon-elite-x-laptops-you-can-buy-today) .

 These laptops are the first tranche of the Copilot+ PCs that Microsoft and Qualcomm launched into the wild. Theyâ€™re touted to have better performance and efficiency than x86 chips and will finally give Microsoft the horsepower it needs to compete against Apple M-Silicon laptops. However, if youâ€™re considering getting one of these devices, we suggest holding off until youâ€™ve seen our real-world reviews of these devices, so you know what youâ€™re getting into when your new Copilot+ PC lands on your desk.
