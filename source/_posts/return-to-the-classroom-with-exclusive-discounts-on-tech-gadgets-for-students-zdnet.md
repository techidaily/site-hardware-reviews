With some [colleges and universities'](https://www.zdnet.com/education/i-graduated-college-last-year-these-are-the-5-essentials-you-actually-need/) fall semesters already underway and many K-12 schools returning before (or shortly after) Labor Day, students of all ages will soon return to their desks five days a week. 

**Also:** [**These 5 gadgets are the college essentials you'll actually reach for**](https://www.zdnet.com/education/i-graduated-college-last-year-these-are-the-5-essentials-you-actually-need/)

But if you're looking to get the best deals on back-to-school tech that will last all year, shopping for the best [laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop-for-college/), [tablets](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-tablets-for-students/), [iPads](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad-for-college/), [earbuds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-earbuds/), and other tech essentials starts early. Plus, if you want to be an even smarter shopper, don't miss out on educational discounts and offers exclusive to students and teachers.

And if you've been eyeing a new Samsung tablet or laptop, you're in luck this school year. Now through Aug. 26, teachers, parents and administrators that are part of Samsung's [Education Offers Program](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fshop%2Foffer-program%2Feducation%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) can earn 30% off at checkout, plus 30% off [Samsung Care+](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fsupport%2Fsamsung-care-plus%2F%3F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) for select PCs, tablets and more for extra protection.

**Also:** [**The best college tech you can buy, according to recent grads**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/10-tech-gadgets-you-actually-need-for-college-according-to-recent-grads/)

Thanks to Samsung's offers, students can save up to $350 on Samsung's newest [Galaxy Book 4 Edge](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-samsungs-new-copilot-pc-and-it-stands-out-from-the-crowd-in-3-major-ways/) laptop right now. ZDNET's Kyle Kucharski tested the [Galaxy Book 4 Edge](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Fcomputing%2Fgalaxy-books%2Fgalaxy-book4-edge%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) back in July, and he called it "a flagship laptop with a gorgeous display, impressive performance, and deep integration with Samsung's ecosystem of devices."

Kucharski says the Book 4 Edge is a Copilot+ PC with the new Snapdragon X Elite processor that's nothing short of a statement-making machine. 

**Also:** [**I tested Samsung's new Copilot+ PC, and it stands out from the crowd in 3 major ways**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-samsungs-new-copilot-pc-and-it-stands-out-from-the-crowd-in-3-major-ways/)

"The laptop feels as good as it looks and nails the features consumers care about the most: a brilliant display, a thin and light form factor, and a marathon battery," he says. "I recently had a chance to go hands-on with the Edge, using it as my primary driver for a week as I commuted to and from the office and worked remotely, and I really enjoyed it. This thing is a banger; It's light, it has lightning-fast performance, a fantastic battery, a gorgeous display, and surprisingly good speakers."

You can also nab other top tech from Samsung, including the [Galaxy Tab A9+ 128GB](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftablets%2Fgalaxy-tab-a9-plus%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-tab-a9-plus-128gb-graphite-wi-fi-sm-x210nzaexar%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1) for up to $40 off and the new [Galaxy Tab A9+ Kids edition](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fus%2Ftablets%2Fgalaxy-tab-a9-plus%2Fbuy%2Fgalaxy-tab-a9-plus-kids-edition-64gb-blue-wi-fi-sm-x210nzavxar%2F&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1).
