## Experience Immersive 3D Art with Asus Latest Laptop Innovation: No VR or AR Needed – Insights

For product designers, artists, and other creative professionals, 3D technology offers a valuable chance to examine a design from every angle, before it goes into production. Typically, however, 3D experiences require a VR/AR headset or glasses. Now, Asus is making it easier to view images in 3D with a new glasses-free 3D OLED display.

Asus calls its new display technology "[Spatial Vision](https://ces.vporoom.com/2023-01-04-ASUS-Presents-Seeing-An-Incredible-Future-at-CES-2023#assets%5F2429%5F126621-111)," and it will be available first on the [ProArt Studiobook 16 3D OLED (H7604)](https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-creators/proart-studiobook/proart-studiobook-16-3d-oled-h7604/) and the [Zenbook Pro 16X OLED (UX7602BZ)](https://www.asus.com/laptops/for-creators/zenbook/zenbook-pro-16x-oled-ux7602/).

With Spatial Vision, users should be able to easily switch between 2D and 3D, with 3D imagery appearing to lift off the screen. The glasses-free (autostereoscopic) 3D OLED technology uses a lenticular lens and advanced eye-tracking camera technology. This allows the display to create distinct images for each eye, which is what creates the 3D effect without the assistance of any wearables. 

The OLED displays offer a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio, a 0.2ms response time, and a 120Hz refresh rate for seamless visuals. To help users get started with innovative displays, Asus offers apps in the Asus Spatial Vision Hub for watching 3D videos and movies, playing 3D games, and enjoying 3D model visualization or content creation.

The ProArt Studiobook 16 opens up 180 degrees.

The ProArt Studiobook 16 3D OLED (H7604) is designed to be a mobile workstation for creators. The laptop screen can lie flat, offering any viewing angle up to 180 degrees. It comes with a 13th Gen Intel Core i9-13980HX processor, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40 Series Laptop GPU, and up to 64GB of upgradeable memory.

The certified color-accurate 16-inch OLED display provides "unrivaled visuals," Asus says, while the device also has a stylus-compatible haptic touchpad and an Asus Dial rotary control.
