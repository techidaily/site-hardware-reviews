## How to connect your Bluetooth headphones to your Mac

Whether you have a MacBook or a desktop Mac computer, these steps will help you to connect your Bluetooth headphones. 

## 1\. Go to Apple's System Preferences

## 3\. Pair your headphones

Once the Bluetooth option expands, you'll see a sidebar that displays any current devices connected via Bluetooth. If you haven't connected any devices before, the box will be empty. 

Now it's time to get your headset involved. Depending on the make and model, there will be a pairing button on either the charging case, usually the situation for earbuds, or on the Bluetooth headphones themselves. If you don't know where the pairing button is, do a quick Google search or look in the manual if you still have it.

Press down on the button until you see the name of your device pop up in the box to the right. Once you see your device's name, Christina's AirPods, for example, toggle the "Connect" option. 

From there, you'll be connected and good to go! No more having private meetings with your boss on speaker for the whole office to hear.

## FAQs

## Why are my Bluetooth headphones not connecting to my Mac? 

If your Bluetooth headphones aren't connecting, make sure that your headset or your buds are charged, powered on, and within range. If they're still not connecting, try turning your Mac on and off and seeing if you need to do any software updates, such as drivers. 

## Can I have two pairs of Bluetooth headphones connected to a Mac at once? 

Yes, it is possible to connect two devices at once. But you will have to go to **Applications > Utilities folder > the AUDIO MIIDI app**. 

## Can you connect Bluetooth earbuds to a Mac that aren't AirPods?

Yes, you can. Just make sure to connect them via the Bluetooth setting via your Mac's system preferences.
