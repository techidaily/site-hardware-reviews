Lenovo's ThinkPads are known for their iconic looks including the red trackpoint, excellent keyboards and solid build quality. The [ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 4](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLenovo-Extreme-Touchscreen-Workstation-Thunderbolt%2Fdp%2FB09RQNBNWL%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Cecf07644-1730-4caa-a999-a20cb2d08009%7Cdtp&dtb=1) has all this, plus a specification that will serve anyone needing to run demanding workloads -- including designers, architects, engineers and creators. Its 16-inch screen hits an increasingly popular sweet spot for laptops, providing more real estate than a 15.6-inch device, and (generally) better portability than a 17-inch one.
