## Top-Rated AirPods : Comprehensive Analysis by Tech Gurus | CNET

If you're a student looking for new earbuds before [returning to school](https://www.zdnet.com/education/i-graduated-college-last-year-these-are-the-5-essentials-you-actually-need/), or someone else in the market for a new pair, AirPods will surely fit the bill -- especially for iPhone owners. 

But before you purchase [AirPods](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-reset-airpods/), you should know they work best with other Apple devices, like [iPhones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-iphone/), [iPads](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-ipad/), and [MacBooks](https://www.zdnet.com/article/macbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-how-to-decide/). Essential features like seamless device switching, spatial audio, and [Find My](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-find-your-lost-airpods-and-what-to-do-before-they-go-missing-again/) only work with these devices. With all that said, if you're in the market for a new pair of AirPods, I'll help you select the AirPods that will best meet your needs and your budget.

**Also: [New AirPods are coming this fall. Here's what we know](https://www.zdnet.com/article/two-new-airpods-models-expected-this-fall-heres-everything-we-know-so-far/)**

Why should you trust me? I have used the AirPods Pro every day since they launched in October 2019, and upgraded to the AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) at launch in 2022\. I have tried every AirPods model and have strong opinions on which pairs are the best for specific use cases. 

## What are the best AirPods for students right now?

My pick for the best AirPods -- the recently-revised [AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0D1XD1ZV3%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C6a66aeb3-cc1a-49d1-8921-f3646dfb0bd9%7Cdtp&dtb=1) \-- is based on my extensive experience using and testing the different versions of AirPods and [competing](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-earbuds/) earbuds from Beats, Soundcore, Samsung, Sony, and many others. But there are a few more AirPods options if you aren't sold on the AirPods Pro 2\. The best AirPods of 2024

Pros 
* Very comfortable to wear
* Impressive sound quality
* Excellent noise cancellation
* Case offers wireless charging

Cons 
* Rarely discounted in seasonal sales
* Volume control gesture doesn't work well

### Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) with USB-C

#### Best AirPods overall

Out of the four current models of AirPods, I recommend the AirPods Pro 2 the most because they fit almost every type of ear, are comfortable to wear, and include all of the best and latest features that Apple offers in headphones. Plus, they get a bonus set of new features as part of the iOS 17 update.

These will be ideal for those long-haul study sessions at the library when all you want is silence and time to focus or as you're exercising at the bustling campus gym and want to lock in on your favorite music. They're the best earbuds in the lineup and a great choice for portable headphones with competitive noise-canceling. 

Most Redditors agree that the AirPods Pro 2 takes the cake. When searching on Reddit for the best AirPods to buy, it isn't easy to find an alternative recommendation. One user on the r/AirPods thread called the earbuds "transcendent," and another said they are worth the money. 

The AirPods Pro 2 uses silicon tips to fit into your ears (with four sizes to choose from), similar to the ones you're probably familiar with in most earbuds you've used. Comparatively, the standard AirPods have hard plastic tips like the traditional [Apple EarPods](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMTN2AM/A/earpods-with-lightning-connector) that used to come in the box with most iPhones -- which many people found to fall out of their ears easily or weren't very comfortable to wear. 

The AirPods Pro 2 were the first to get Apple's latest H2 chip for improved sound. That includes active noise cancellation, which roughly doubles the noise cancellation of the first-gen AirPods Pro and works impressively in loud environments like airplanes and city streets. It also includes adaptive transparency mode, which lets you hear the world around you when you have your earbuds in while also automatically reducing loud sounds such as sirens. 

In 2023, Apple slightly revised this model as the "AirPods Pro (2nd Generation) with USB-C," swapping out Apple's Lightening connector with the more universal USB-C that has also come to iPhone 15\. But it also added Lossless Audio with ultra-low latency for the Apple [Vision Pro headset](https://www.zdnet.com/article/meet-apples-vision-pro-price-features-hands-on-insights-and-everything-you-need-to-know/) that launched this week.

If you use headphones for more than a couple hours every day, wireless headphones might be your most important device next to your smartphone and your laptop -- and they can enhance the experience of using both. If you use headphones that much, spending $250 on the best and most versatile wireless earbuds Apple offers will likely be a worthy investment to raise the quality of your daily life.

Pros 
* Pairs with all your Apple devices
* Noise cancellation is outstanding
* Transparency mode is realistic
* More comfortable than most over-ear headphones

Cons 
* Eye-watering price tag
* Sound quality is about the same as less expensive headphones
* You'll need to buy a real case

### Apple AirPods Max

#### Best AirPods for travelers and audiophiles

The AirPods Max are Apple's most premium headphones, and they even do a few specific things better than the AirPods Pro 2, which have more advanced technology thanks to Apple's H2 chip. Regarding immersive sound and blocking out the world, the AirPods Max offers a glorious experience at a premium price of $550 -- although you can find sales and discounts to knock off a chunk of that price.

The noise cancellation for the AirPods Max is the best I've experienced. I used it on a very loud and long flight, where I was seated just over one of the engines with a constant roar. Putting on the AirPods Max brought almost complete silence and a welcome bit of peace. Equally vital is the transparency mode, where the eight microphones in the AirPods Max make it sound like you're not wearing a pair of over-the-ear headphones. The quality of these two modes is better than any other traditional headphones I've used. It is the main reason to buy the AirPods Max -- along with the fact that they can pair with all your Apple devices and automatically switch between any of them. 

Here's another reason to buy the AirPods Max: comfort. I've never been able to wear most over-the-ear headphones for more than 30 minutes because they are uncomfortable on my ears and make the sides of my head sweaty. I've been able to wear the AirPods Max for several hours on long flights because the ear cushions are comfortable and ventilate well. Because of this, these headphones are the perfect library companion for deep focus ahead of finals and mid-terms. 

The audio quality of the AirPods Max is excellent, but it's generally about the same as that of other wireless over-the-ear headphones, which cost $250-$350\. If you have multiple Apple devices, truly love audio or immersing yourself in your favorite music or movie, and are a frequent traveler, then you're likely to love the experience of the AirPods Max. Just keep in mind that you'll probably also need a separate pair of earbuds for walking outside, working out, and wearing under a warm cap in cold weather. 

Owners on Reddit say the AirPods Max is worth it if you have $500 to spare. Some users recommend waiting for the next generation of these headphones, though it's TBD when that next generation arrives.

Pros 
* Can work across all your Apple devices
* Often discounted to $99
* Iconic original design
* Easy to use

Cons 
* They don't fit in all ears
* Missing latest AirPods innovations
* No water or sweat resistance

### Apple AirPods (2nd Generation)

#### Best AirPods for the price

The original AirPods remain as iconic as ever. They are still available to purchase in the upgraded 2nd-generation version, even if the newer generations of AirPods, like the Pro 2s, have made this generation less popular, according to Reddit. While they retail for $129, they regularly go on sale for $99 at Amazon and other places. With their solid sound, easy setup, ability to connect to all your Apple devices, and 5-hour battery life, the AirPods 2nd gen are a very straightforward buy. 

A fully charged case can charge the AirPods 2nd gen up to five times. With up to five hours of battery life on each charge, that results in over 24 hours before you need a full recharge of the case and the AirPods. 

**Also:** [**How I used the same AirPods for five years straight (and you can, too)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-i-used-the-same-airpods-for-five-years-straight-and-you-can-too/)

Aside from not having the latest tech available in the AirPods Pro 2, the biggest drawback to these earbuds is that their hard plastic tips don't fit into everyone's ears and sometimes drop out. That's not ideal, especially for an expensive product where falling out could mean losing an AirPod down a drain or a subway tunnel. So, I'd recommend getting silicone ear tips (such as) to keep them more securely in your ears -- even though it can be a bit of pain to have to carry the extra ear tips and to take them off and on between uses.

If you can live with their drawbacks, the AirPods 2nd gen is a great first introduction to Apple's wireless headphones. They're an excellent option for students who want earbuds in the Apple ecosystem but aren't picky about special features or noise-canceling.

Pros 
* Refined version of original design
* Spatial audio surround sound
* Adaptive EQ
* Water and sweat resistance

Cons 
* Don't fit in all ears
* Don't have latest H2 chip
* No noise cancellation or transparency mode

### Apple AirPods (3rd Generation)

#### Best traditional AirPods

The AirPods (3rd Generation) offer nearly all of the same high-end audio features as the AirPods Pro 2 -- except for noise cancellation and transparency mode -- but at a lower price of $169, or $179 with the wireless case, which is well worth it. That means you get spatial audio surround sound, adaptive EQ using Apple's algorithms to adjust the sound quality, better dynamic range, an extra 20% battery life per charge, and faster charging while in the case. (Five minutes in the case gives an hour of usage time.) 

These AirPods also integrate more controls directly into the stems. With the AirPods 3rd gen, you can press once to play/pause or answer a call, twice to skip forward, three times to skip back, and press and hold to activate Siri. Those are the same controls the AirPods Pro 2 have (minus the volume control gesture that doesn't work well).

The AirPods 3rd gen suffers from the same ear fit issues as the first two generations of traditional AirPods. For some AirPods 3 owners on Reddit, the hard plastic tips won't stay in your ears or will fall out easily, depending on the shape of your ears. I'd recommend getting some silicone ear hooks, as mentioned above, for the AirPods 2nd gen; however, the silicone tips for the 2nd gen won't fit the 3rd gen because of the new design. So I'd suggest getting  for the AirPods 3rd gen if these fit loosely in your ears or have issues falling out.

The AirPods 3rd gen are generally the Apple headphones that are the hardest to recommend. That's because -- if you want the least expensive entry into the AirPods experience -- the AirPods 2nd gen is a no-brainer at $99\. And if you're seeking a more advanced pair with the latest features and upgrades, then you want the AirPods Pro 2 -- even at $249, they could be worth the investment if you spend multiple hours a day with headphones on. The AirPods 3rd gen sits uncomfortably in the middle between those two products. There are people out there who prefer the traditional hard plastic fit to the silicone ear tips. If you're one of those and want to get most of the features of the AirPods Pro 2 but want to save $70, these are the ones for you.

## What are the best Apple AirPods?

| AirPods (3rd Generation)                                     | Most of the features of the Pro earbuds, but with the hard plastic tips and for $70 less. |

## Factors to consider when choosing the best AirPods:

In evaluating the four models of AirPods, I've especially focused on these four factors:

* **Cost**: Budget is where most people start, so we always have to keep that at the forefront of the conversation about AirPods. The AirPods on this list cost anywhere from $99 to $550, depending on the model you choose, the AirPods generation, the features included in the pair like noise cancellation and spatial audio, and whether you're opting for earbuds or the AirPods Max. All of these factors will raise the price of a pair significantly, but also the quality level.
* **Features**: The things that determine how AirPods work and what you can do with them are always going to be at the center of consideration, so we have to look at noise cancellation, transparency mode, spatial audio, water resistance, charging case, interface controls, and other key features.
* **Battery life**: Few things affect daily use more than battery life, so we have to take that into account when considering the usefulness of each product. The AirPods on this list have battery life that ranges from six to 20 hours.
* **Chip**: To power the AirPods, Apple has both the H1 and H2 chips. These are the key to a number of features as well as the software upgradeability of the AirPods, as we've seen with the nice feature bump that the AirPods Pro 2 got in iOS 17 because they have the H2.

## How did we test these AirPods?

I have been using AirPods every day for over five years, and have tried all of the various models. I've also used many other wireless earbuds, wireless over-the-ear headphones, and wired earbuds and headphones. I've used inexpensive $20 models and I've used ones that cost over $500\. I've taken all of that experience and used it to make recommendations on the best AirPods to buy, based on the AirPods' performance, battery life, customer reviews, your needs, your use cases, and your budget.

ZDNET only spotlights products we actually recommend to people, and when we like a product, we will spotlight it or write an official review, and then put the product on one of these best lists. 

To learn more about our approach to headphone and earbud testing, read [our article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-headphones/) on the topic. 

## Is Apple coming out with new AirPods anytime soon?

It's looking like two new AirPods models are coming our way shortly. One will be an inexpensive pair, predicted to be priced at around $100, and the other will be a new pair of AirPods Max, as ZDNET's Nina Raemont writes. Both AirPods models will feature USB-C charging, a new design, and a comfortable, improved fit. 

**More: [New AirPods Lite and AirPods Max expected later this year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/new-airpods-lite-and-airpods-max-expected-later-this-year/)**

## What are the best cheap Apple AirPods?

The Apple AirPods (2nd Generation) cost $129 and regularly go on sale for $99 or less. These are the original AirPods with some upgraded internal features from 2019 and they don't have the latest technologies you'll find in the AirPods Pro 2\. But at less than half the price of the Pro model, the AirPods 2nd gen are an enticing first pair of Apple wireless earbuds.

## Which AirPods are better: the AirPods Pro 2 or the AirPods 3?

We think the AirPods Pro 2 run circles over the AirPods 3, for their value, their comfort, the noise cancellation, and much more. And many AirPods Pro 2 owners agree -- just look at any Reddit thread about which earbuds to buy and you'll find the AirPods Pro 2 the clear winner. People report that the AirPods 3 are much bigger and less comfortable, plus they don't come with the stellar noise cancellation of the AirPods Pro 2\. 

## Why are the AirPods 3 cheaper than the AirPods Pro 2?

The AirPods 3 are cheaper than the AirPods Pro 2 because the earbuds don't come with as many bells and whistles as the AirPods Pro 2\. The Pro 2, for example, come with noise cancellation, transparency mode, and Apple's latest H2 chip, two things the AirPods 3 lack. This naturally raises the price of the AirPods Pro 2\. 

## What are good alternatives to AirPods? 

There are plenty, from Sony's WF-1000XM5 earbuds, to Bose's QuietComfort Ultra earbuds, there are tons of competitive earbud options from other brands, if you're not keen on Apple. 

## How much do Apple AirPods cost?

Apple AirPods come in four different models and four different retail price tags: AirPods 2nd Generation ($129), AirPods 3rd Generation ($169), AirPods Pro 2nd Generation with USB-C ($249), AirPods Max ($549). 

## What's the lowest price AirPods go for? 

So, there's Apple's price that it sells its products for, and then there's the lower price e-commerce sites like Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart are actually selling the products for. You'll see the AirPods 2nd gen sell for $129 on Apple's site and $90 on Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. Apple sells its most expensive AirPods Max for $549, while Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart regularly discount the price to $480\. And, finally, for the AirPods Pro 2, our best overall pick, Apple sells the earbuds for $250, while Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart regularly sell it for $190\. 

## Other products we tested:

While the Apple AirPods are often a great pick if you are deeply embedded in the Apple ecosystem, ZDNET has also tested a lot of other great earbuds and headphones from other companies as well. So, don't miss the rest of our picks for the [best headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-headphones/), the [best earbuds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-earbuds/), and the [best noise-canceling headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-noise-canceling-headphones/).
