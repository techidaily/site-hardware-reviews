Most 17-inch laptops tip the scales at well over 4 pounds, which makes LG's 2.98lb [Gram 17](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLG-Lightweight-Display-Processor-Thunderbolt%2Fdp%2FB09XGXTXRB%3Fref%3Ddlx%5Fcyber%5Fgd%5Fdcl%5Fimg%5F4%5F48651b7e%5Fdt%5Fsl7%5Fba%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C9797522e-4da3-4e7b-a85c-3e9309d071b3%7Cdtp&dtb=1) a remarkable device that will give it particularly appeal for creators, knowledge workers and undemanding gamers who want to maximise screen real estate without sacrificing too much portability. 

Obviously it's still a bulky device, measuring ‎14.91in. wide by 10.19in. deep by 0.7in. thick, but the LG Gram 17's weight really puts it in a class of its own.

The LG Gram 17 is available in multiple configurations, but the model on offer here is based on Intel's 12th-generation [Core i7-1260P](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/226254/intel-core-i71260p-processor-18m-cache-up-to-4-70-ghz.html) processor with 32GB of RAM, 2TB of SSD storage (2x 1TB) and integrated Intel Iris Xe Graphics.

The all-important 17-inch display is a 16:10 WQXGA (2560x1600) IPS panel with a non-reflective design and support for 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut. It sits in narrow bezels with a Windows Hello-supporting 1080p webcam at the top. The chassis provides room for a keyboard with a separate number pad and a large touchpad.

[LG Gram 17 2022 (save $400) $1,700 at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLG-Lightweight-Display-Processor-Thunderbolt%2Fdp%2FB09XGXTXRB%3Fref%3Ddlx%5Fcyber%5Fgd%5Fdcl%5Fimg%5F4%5F48651b7e%5Fdt%5Fsl7%5Fba%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C9797522e-4da3-4e7b-a85c-3e9309d071b3%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

Connections run to two USB-A (3.2 Gen2x1), two Thunderbolt 4/USB4, HDMI and a 3.5mm headphone jack. One of the USB-C ports will be used to charge the 80Wh battery, which powers the Gram 17 for up to 12.5 hours (under MobileMark 18) or 17.5 hours of video playback, according to LG.

This lightweight 17-inch laptop performs well enough under mainstream productivity workloads but its lack of discrete graphics puts demanding games out of reach. Creators would probably appreciate a memory card slot, but otherwise there are few drawbacks with this standout large-screen laptop.
