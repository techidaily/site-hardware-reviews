## Level Up Your Game with Discounted Lenovo Legion: Immersive Experience, RTX Graphics & Crystal-Clear 240 Hz Visuals at Unbeatable Prices

Some of the[best gaming laptops](https://tools.techidaily.com) come with Nvidia's RTX 4080, but they're typically pricey. As[Prime Day](https://tools.techidaily.com) and competitive sales continue,[B&H has the Lenovo Legion Pro 7i selling for $2,049](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1745683-REG/lenovo%5F82wq002rus%5F16%5Flegion%5Fpro%5F7.html?BI=20811&KBID=16572&SID=tomshardware-us-6265501791757029013) , down from $2,799.  
  
 On paper, this is a potent machine. Lenovo pairs that RTX 4080 with an Intel Core i9-13900HX, 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Sure, that's not the most recent Intel CPU, but there hasn't been a major difference between 13th and 14th Gen. It would be nice to see a 2TB drive for the price, but you can always upgrade that down the line if you need more storage. (You can also take a look at[our favorite SSD deals](https://tools.techidaily.com) .)

**Lenovo Legion Pro 7i 16 with RTX 4080:** [**now $2,049 at B&H Photo**](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1745683-REG/lenovo%5F82wq002rus%5F16%5Flegion%5Fpro%5F7.html/?BI=20811&KBID=16572&SID=tomshardware-us-6231854356628811207) (was $2,799)  
 This 16-inch laptop comes packed with a Core i9-13900HX processor, 32GB of DDR5 memory, an RTX 4080 GPU, and a 1TB SSD. In addition, it features a 16-inch QHD+ display with a 240Hz refresh rate.

 The 16-inch display has a 2560 x 1600 resolution with a 240 Hz refresh rate that supports both FreeSync and G-Sync. It's not OLED, but it should be plenty bright based on the spec sheet, and that refresh rate is great for esports.  
  
 It's been a while since we've reviewed the Legion Pro 7i, but[the last time we did](https://tools.techidaily.com) , we appreciated its bright screen, comfortable keyboard, clear audio, and gaming prowess.  
  
 This isn't the lowest price we've ever seen the Legion Pro 7i — it broke past the $2,000 mark on Black Friday — but getting an RTX 4080 with these other specs to back it up for this price is still a solid deal.
