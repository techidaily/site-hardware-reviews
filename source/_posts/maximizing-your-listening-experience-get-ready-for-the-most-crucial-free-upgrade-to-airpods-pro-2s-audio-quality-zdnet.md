## Maximizing Your Listening Experience: Get Ready for the Most Crucial Free Upgrade to AirPods Pro 2'S Audio Quality | ZDNET

Today, Apple announced a list of upgrades to its AirPods lineup, including [two new AirPods 4 models](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airpods%2Fairpods-4&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp), hardware upgrades to the over-ear AirPods Max, and significant software upgrades to its premium earbuds, the [AirPods Pro 2](https://apple.sjv.io/c/159047/435031/7613?&sharedid=zdnet&partnerpropertyid=1980086&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airpods%2Fairpods-pro-2&subId1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp).

Later this fall, when [iOS 18](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-iphone-model-that-will-be-updated-to-apples-ios-18-and-which-ones-cant/) is available for download, AirPods Pro 2 users will be able to access software features like [Siri Interactions and Voice Isolation](https://www.zdnet.com/article/3-useful-features-coming-to-apple-airpods-this-fall-but-only-for-these-models/), unveiled in June during the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference.

More notable features coming to the Pro 2 earbuds include a clinically validated hearing test to assess the wearer's hearing capabilities and monitor gradual hearing loss. Users can complete a hearing test on their iPhone when wearing the Pro 2 to access insights and metrics. Additionally, the Pro 2 can double as an over-the-counter (OTC) hearing aid, a feature first reported by Bloomerg's Mark Gurman in March.

Apple is still waiting for the FDA to approve the Pro 2 earbuds as OTC hearing aids, but the company expects this feature to be available in over 100 countries by the end of the year. A device must not require implantation or surgical intervention, must be prescription-free, and must allow customization of features through tools or tests to be categorized as an OTC hearing aid.

Considering these benchmarks, we can infer that the Pro 2 will automatically adjust themselves in hearing aid mode based on the user's hearing test results. OTC hearing aids are recommended for people with mild to moderate hearing loss, helping people with difficulty hearing conversations in noisy environments or following conversations with multiple speakers.

According to the FDA, almost 30 million Americans experience hearing loss, but only one-fifth seek medical intervention. Historically, people have avoided hearing aids due to their bulky and unfashionable appearance. 

However, we all know someone who always has AirPods in their ears, and making an OTC hearing aid indistinguishable from a pair of AirPods is a great way to make a piece of everyday technology accessible and suitable for everyone.

Hearing aid mode will only be available on the AirPods Pro 2, which [typically retail for $249](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-airpods-pro-2nd-generation-with-magsafe-case-usbc-white%2F6447382.p%3FskuId%3D6447382&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1). However, during seasonal sales, you can regularly find them as low as $189.

If you already have the AirPods Pro 2, they will automatically update the new software once it's available. There is no AirPods app, so AirPods software is wrapped into the iOS updates on your iPhone.
