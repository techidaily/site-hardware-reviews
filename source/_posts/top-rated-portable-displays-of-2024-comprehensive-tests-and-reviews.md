## Duex Plus monitor

### Best portable monitor overall

**Duex Plus by Mobile Pixels tech specs: Size:** 13.3 inches | **Panel type:** IPS | **Resolution:** 1080p | **Touchscreen:** No | **HDR:** No | **Refresh rate:** 60 Hz | **Power:** USB-C

After going hands-on with the Duex Plus portable monitor, we can say that its lightweight build, surprisingly easy set-up, and slide-out mechanism make it June Wan's "productivity secret weapon." 

"Portable monitors come in all shapes and sizes, but the Mobile Pixels Duex Plus' slide-out mechanism is the most seamless way I've found to integrate a second screen with my laptop," said Wan in his [full review](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/this-flip-out-portable-monitor-is-my-productivity-secret-weapon/). "If you want a dual-screen setup without the hassle of carrying a separate monitor, then this is as good as it gets," he says of its ultimate portability feature. 

**Review:** [**Duex Plus by Mobile Pixels**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/smart-office/this-flip-out-portable-monitor-is-my-productivity-secret-weapon/)

The 1080p full HD display has anti-glare technology for greater clarity with a 16:9 aspect ratio. In all, the screen measures 13.3 inches, making for a manageable size, and is adjustable, thanks to a special G-sensor that is responsible for its auto-rotation design. There is both USB A and Type-C connectivity to keep your monitor more easily powered. And, with a plastic and aluminum alloy build, it's both portable and fairly durable.

## Hongo 16.1-inch portable monitor

### Best budget portable monitor

**Hongo** **portable monitor** **tech specs:** **Size:** 16.1 inches | **Panel type:** IPS | **Resolution:** 1920 x 1080P | **Touchscreen:** No | **HDR:** No | **Refresh rate:** 60 Hz | **Power:** USB-C

A second display doesn't need to break the bank to provide quality imaging. Whether you are using it for gaming or remote work, the Hongo 16.1-inch portable monitor is a quality portable monitor that provides a bright and crisp display at a relatively affordable price. 

For just $160, it offers 144Hz refresh rate, USB-Type C, USB, and HDMI connectivity, and you can switch between horizontal and vertical modes. If you are interested in a portable monitor that can connect to various types of devices and does not leave a hole in your pocket, then the Hongo 16.1-inch may be the monitor for you.

When ZDNET contributor Jack Wallen got his hands on this monitor, he was surprised at how much brighter this under-$200 monitor was in comparison to his over-$1,000 Dell 34-inch monitor. "Not only has the extra screen made a huge difference, but the monitor is a significant improvement over what past portable monitors I've used. It's clearer, brighter, and less prone to flicker than my portable monitor of the past," he writes.

## What is the right portable monitor for you?

Once you've locked down the best budget for your portable monitor, you then have to identify what you want the display to do for you. Do you want to play games while out and about, or do you want a secondary screen for easier multitasking while tackling work projects and presentations? 

While shopping for a portable monitor, you should keep in mind what screen size, refresh rate, resolution, and connectivity works best with your setup as well as keep mindful of the monitor's power source. Portable monitors with integrated batteries have varying charging and battery lifetimes, while those that get power via USB-C connections can drain your laptop battery faster.

This table shows which portable monitor might work for you based on purpose:

## How did we choose these portable monitors?

There are several factors to keep in mind when choosing the best monitor for your needs. These are some factors we considered when choosing the best portable monitors.

* **Size:** It is critical that you find not only the best portable monitor for the type of computer you have but also one for the type of computer size that you have. Most portable monitors range from 13 inches to 16 inches, but you can find some models available outside that range.
* **Display**: One of the most important things to consider is the quality of your display, such as the resolution that determines how sharp and focused your picture will be. Be sure to also check specs for brightness and color to ensure that you have the best computer display possible.

* **Power:** Most portable monitors are battery-powered, but models are increasingly converting to USB charging for easier, more convenient charging on the go. Check your computer to see what kind of ports are available before matching a portable monitor to your computer or laptop.
* **Price:** The cost of portable monitors can vary significantly, ranging from a couple hundred to a thousand or more. We found that the best portable monitors are rather affordable, ranging in cost from $270 to $470, respectively.

## What is a portable monitor?

These small-form screens connect to laptops, tablets, and game consoles via mini HDMI or USB-C cables for fast, consistent video playback as well as power for the monitor. Some portable monitors even have integrated batteries for use without power over USB-C; and while their battery lives are on the short side (about three or four hours at most), they're a great option for mobile professionals who can't always be near a wall outlet for a typical desktop monitor or need USB-C connections.

## What screen sizes do portable monitors come in?

Portable monitors will consistently have much less real estate than their [desktop counterparts](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-desktop-deals/), but you still have a variety of options when it comes to display size. Most screens will be somewhere between 14 and 17 inches, making them similar to a typical laptop display and therefore perfect for mobile professionals or anyone who doesn't have a lot of desk space. 

However, there are a few, like the Asus ProArt PQ22UC, that are closer to 22 inches, making them better suited for creative professionals and digital artists who may need more room to edit photos and video or create digital drawings and paintings.

## Why should I get a portable monitor?

Portable monitors are great for anyone who may need extra screen space while working on the go or while using a smaller-than-average work desk. Since these mobile screens are about the same size as a laptop or tablet display, they're great for slipping into a laptop bag for when you're meeting an off-site client to go over project details or finishing up a presentation on your business flight. 

They can also be great for mobile console or PC gaming, as long as you choose a portable monitor with a high enough refresh rate to provide smooth playback away from home.
