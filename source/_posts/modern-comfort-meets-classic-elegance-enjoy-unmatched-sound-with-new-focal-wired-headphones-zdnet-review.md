Headphones have significantly improved recently, showcasing noise-canceling properties, Bluetooth connectivity, and battery longevity improvements. Sometimes, however, all of these things are, well, annoying. Unreliable tap-and-swipe controls, hard-to-find buttons, laggy Bluetooth connections, and dying batteries can be the bane of your listening experience.

Finding [headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-headphones/) with an analog yet elevated audio experience can be like finding a needle in a haystack. Fortunately, the new [Focal Azurys](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=13867&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomingdales.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Ffocal-azurys-closed-back-headphones-blue%3FID%3D5235668) are a headphone-shaped needle. These headphones are as simple as they get -- no buttons or companion apps -- simply plug in and listen. Are they worth it? Read on to find out.

[ZDNET RECOMMENDS Focal Azurys The new Focal Azurys headphones deliver an opulent design, feel, and sound. View at Bloomingdales](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=IokOf8qagZo&mid=13867&u1=zd-%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F-dtp&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomingdales.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2Ffocal-azurys-closed-back-headphones-blue%3FID%3D5235668)

I won't bury the lede -- these headphones are not cheap. To be fair, Focal manufactures a $300 headphone stand, so you can see what we're working with. Focal produces high-end, high-fidelity luxury headphones, and the Azurys are the company's bid at garnering the attention (and money) of people who don't want to pay upwards of $5,000 for its other offerings.

The Azurys retail for $549, an entry-level price tag in Focal-land, but these headphones are not elementary by any means. The 40mm drivers sport an M-shaped speaker dome made from aluminum and magnesium, a patented custom-made design manufactured in France.

Thanks to these drivers, the Azurys have a natural and relaxed soundstage. They also have impeccable instrument separation and audio imaging, which is nothing unusual for Focal. Songs like The 1975's _Oh Caroline_ sound brilliant. The song's yacht rock vibes and the lead singer's subtle harmonies shine through the Azurys.

If you're a big bass fan, these headphones won't do it for you. There is a present and enjoyable bass response, but it's modest and unassuming, which is on point for high-fidelity headphones. When I listened to Kendrick Lamar's _Money Trees,_ I could appreciate the beach rock musical undertones, and Lamar's vocals were transparent.

The bass guitar in Harry Styles's _Cinema_ was present and tight, reproducing great detail in the lower frequencies. Overall, the Azurys have a well-balanced sound that's not harsh in the upper range or too heavy in the lower range. If bass-heavy music, like hip-hop and EDM, dominates your playlists, you'll miss out on the punch and thump you likely prefer.

The Azurys are wired headphones, so going wireless isn't an option. Thankfully, they have a 26-ohm impedance, which means your smartphone or laptop likely has enough power to drive these headphones to their fullest potential. You can use an affordable digital-to-analog converter like Apple's USB-C to 3.5mm adapter.

Focal says the Azurys can be your audio companion at home or on the go due to its closed-back design. With the lack of Bluetooth and noise-canceling capabilities, however, I don't think many people will find these headphones suitable for noisy commutes.

People who can hear the blemishes in Bluetooth audio will appreciate these headphones for on-the-go listening. Most people outside that audience might find the necessary wires, lack of noise-canceling tech, and sound leakage bothersome.

Focal furnished the Azurys with memory foam earpads fitted with braided textile and the headband with genuine leather. The Azurys' thick earpads provide some passive noise isolation, but only enough to muffle low evening chatter. The high-quality build is comfortable, and the metallic blue color is bold, stylish, and eye-catching. You also get a sturdy carrying case to store your headphones when they're not in use.

### ZDNET's buying advice

The new [Focal Azurys headphones](https://www.bloomingdales.com/shop/product/focal-azurys-closed-back-headphones-blue) are a stellar way to access Focal's sophisticated headphone design and renowned audio innovations. These headphones are cheaper than most of Focal's catalog, so if you've wanted to experience Focal without spending thousands of dollars, the Azurys are your entry point.

It may be challenging to justify paying $549 for headphones that lack Bluetooth or noise-canceling technology, especially when similarly priced headphones have those elements _plus_ wired listening options. 

Still, Focal's attention to sound detail is unmatched, and the Azurys are worth paying for if you are a hi-fi fanatic. If you want headphones with a similar retro feel and impressive audio capabilities, consider the [Audio-Technica ATH-M20xBT2](https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-200-headphones-are-recommended-by-audio-experts-and-i-understand-why/). If you can't deal with wires, but exceptional sound is nonnegotiable, consider the [Sonos Ace](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonos-ace-review/).
