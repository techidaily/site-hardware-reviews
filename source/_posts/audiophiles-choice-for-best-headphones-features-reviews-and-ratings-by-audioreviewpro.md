Pros 
* Long battery life
* Rich sound profile
* Comfortable design

Cons 
* ANC could be better for the high price

### Sonos Ace

#### Best headphones overall

The Sonos Ace results from the company's many years of work creating its first pair of over-ear headphones. The Ace headphones are stacked with audio features, like compatibility with Dolby Atmos, noise-canceling, and transparency modes. These headphones' standout feature is their integration with the Sonos soundbars via a TV audio swap feature. This feature allows users to seamlessly transfer audio from their Sonos Arc, Beam, or Ray to the Ace headphones.

The Ace headphones deliver 30 hours of continuous playback, but you can recover three hours of battery life in a three-minute quick charge. The Ace debuted with thoughtful design features, like removable ear pads and color-coded ear cups. 

**Review: [Sonos Ace](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sonos-ace-review/)**

The Sonos Ace are compatible with Dolby Atmos, which was highly immersive when I watched movies and TV shows and listened to music. The TV audio swap feature is impressive, and the Sonos Ace are incredibly comfortable headphones. Additionally, they are stylish and have a simplistic design, staying true to Sonos' dedication to creating products with an unassuming visual presence.

When I reviewed the Sonos Ace, I was thoroughly impressed by their rich sound profile. However, their ANC is weaker for their near $500 price tag. But if noise-canceling isn't your top priority, the Ace headphones offer immense comfort, a vibrant and exciting sound profile, and an elevated design.

If touch controls aren't your preference, the Ace sports two multifunction buttons, notably, the Content Key. You can slide and press this button to control audio commands and toggle the TV Audio Swap. Overall, the Ace headphones are a pair of fresh, premium headphones that any audio lover will enjoy.

Still, if you're looking for headphones with better noise-canceling properties, I recommend the Bose QuietComfort Ultra headphones or the Apple AirPods Max headphones. 

**Sonos Ace** **tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth:** Yes (5.4) | **Battery life:** 30 hours (ANC on) | **Driver size:** 40mm dynamic | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Wired** **option(s):** USB-C

Pros 
* Best-in-class ANC

Cons

### Bose QuietComfort Ultra

#### Best noise-canceling headphones

Bose's latest release challenges its competitors in the noise-canceling and comfort department, as the name QuietComfort suggests. I wear these headphones during intensive writing sessions at my desk, while traveling, and while lounging. Bose improved the QC Ultra's soundstage with this model, offering a more profound, fuller bass response than any other Bose headphones I've tested.

The vegan leather ear pads have perforations to allow for better breathability, decreasing the likelihood of these headphones making your ears feel hot. Even after hours of wear, it's easy to forget you're wearing the QC Ultra on your head -- they're that comfortable.

**Review:** [**Bose QuietComfort Ultra**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-headphones-review/)

The QC Ultra's noise-canceling is the best I've tried in any headphones, as the ANC offers you protection from low, middle, and high-pitched droning noises like a lawnmower, car engine, or running refrigerator. Unlike other ANC headphones, the QC Ultra do a great job at diminishing light conversational noises, making them a great companion for people working in public spaces, like a library or coffee shop.

However, the QC Ultra are on the expensive side, retailing at $429 and remaining over $350 even with seasonal discounts. Additionally, their battery life is 24 hours, so if you wear your headphones a lot, you'll need to plug in a few times a week. The Bose Music app offers a three-band equalizer and options for you to customize the commands on the right ear cup's capacitive touch strip.

The QC Ultra have a simple and premium design, offering aluminum hinges and ear cups with soft matte coating. They don't look as sleek as Apple's AirPods Max or Sonos' Ace, but if your aesthetic is sportier and more casual, the QC Ultra will suit your style.

If you're ready to splurge on a pair of premium everyday headphones with exceptional noise-canceling, I can't recommend these more.

**Bose QuietComfort Ultra** **tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth:** Yes (5.3) | **Battery life:** 24 hours (ANC off) | **Driver size:** 35mm dynamic | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Wired** **option(s):** 3.5mm headphone jack

### Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones

#### Best headphones for software fanatics

The Sony XM5 over-ear headphones are some of the most popular ones on the market, and that's for good reason. These headphones have exceptional noise-canceling properties, great sound, a solid battery life, all-day comfort, and a sleek and premium design.

When Sony released these headphones in 2022, they were packed with software features competing headphones lacked, like Speak-to-Chat. This feature pauses your music when the headphones detect that you're speaking to someone and enables transparency mode so you can better hear them.

The XM5's 40-hour battery life means you can wear these headphones throughout the week with minimal charging, making them great for commuters, travelers, and desk workers. Not to mention, the impressive noise-canceling is some of the best out there. 

**Review:** [**Sony WH-1000XM5**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/sony-wh-1000xm5-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-review/)

When ZDNET's Matthew Miller reviewed the XM5 headphones, he said the noise-canceling tech allows for "an environment of isolation and focus," so these headphones are fabulous to wear when you need to block out the world around you. 

The XM5 headphones offer plenty of practicality with their oversized ear cups and impressive battery life. Sony's XM5 allow access to Sony's LDAC Bluetooth codec and don't need to be turned on to listen over a wired connection, so you can listen even if the battery is dead.

The XM5's design is utilitarian and simple, making them best for people with a toned-down personal style. If you want headphones that can match any outfit, the XM5 are a solid option.

**Sony WH-1000XM5 tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth:** Yes (5.2) | **Battery life:** 40 hours (ANC off) | **Driver size:** 30mm dynamic | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Wired option(s):** 3.5mm headphone jack

Pros 
* Stylish
* Comfortable
* Long battery life

Cons 
* Expensive
* No spatial audio

### Dyson OnTrac

#### Best headphones for unique style

The OnTrac headphones, a stylish and unique-looking pair of over-ear headphones, mark Dyson's second venture into the consumer audio world. The OnTrac feature noise-canceling properties, over 55 hours of continuous playtime, and a USB-C port for lossless wired listening. 

However, the OnTrac's most compelling feature is its design. Dyson fitted the OnTrac with removable ear pads and ear cups, meaning you can mix and match the OnTrac's look to suit your aesthetic. Their oversized ear cups offer outstanding comfort, and the aluminum headband and microfiber ear pads deliver an expensive feel.

**Review: [Dyson OnTrac](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-dysons-500-flagship-headphones-and-theyre-more-competitive-than-expected/)**

When I tested the OnTrac, I was surprised by how well the noise-canceling performed and how immersive the sound was. If you prefer crystal-clear vocals, these headphones won't deliver; instrumentals can overshadow vocals through these cans. However, instrumental clarity and separation are where these headphones shine. 

The OnTrac lack spatial audio, so you'll want to skip over these headphones if that's a must-have audio feature. But if audio health is more your speed, the MyDyson app offers real-time hearing health metrics to ensure you aren't damaging your ears with loud noises inside and outside the ear cups.

With up to 55 hours of playtime with ANC turned off, the OnTrac headphones are a wonderful companion for long hauls and extended traveling sessions. Despite the OnTrac's over-the-top looks, they are a pair of functional and reliable headphones.

If you prefer headphones to be as much of a piece of technology as a fashion statement or conversation starter, the Dyson OnTrac won't disappoint.

**Dyson OnTrac tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth:** Yes (5.0) | **Battery life:** 55 hours (ANC off) |**Driver size:** 40mm dynamic | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Wired option(s):** USB-C

### Beats Studio Pro

#### Best headphones for mixed-device ecosystems

The Beats Studio Pro are an impressive pair of over-ear headphones from Beats -- dare I say they are the best over-ear headphones from Apple? Beats released the Studio Pro last year, and they debuted with a list of upgrades, like USB-C charging and audio, spatial audio, Find My compatibility, and more.

The Studio Pro were Beats' first headphones since the company was acquired by Apple in 2014\. Their muted, toned-down design echoes Apple's simplistic design choices. The Studio Pro sport large, oval ear cups made with UltraPlush padding fitted with faux leather materials for added comfort. 

**Review: [Beats Studio Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/beats-studio-pro-review/)**

The Studio Pro's standout feature is its unique compatibility with native iOS and Android features. For example, iOS users can add the Studio Pro to their Find My network and listen in Spatial Audio. Android users receive Bluetooth multipoint connectivity and download the Beats companion app for more customization.

Now that newer iPhones sport USB-C ports, Android users and compatible iPhones can plug into the Studio Pro to listen to lossless audio and charge the headphones while plugged into their phone. Plugging into the Studio Pro's USB-C port also unlocks Entertainment and Conversation audio modes, which enhance the listening experience when watching movies or taking phone calls.

The Studio Pro are equipped with noise-canceling and Transparency modes, which were efficient and reliable when I tested them. The Studio Pro's sound profile is warm and slightly bass-forward but significantly less bass-heavy than Beats' previous headphones.

You can expect the Studio Pro to deliver up to 40 hours of continuous playback without any audio modes enabled. Still, that number decreases to about 24 hours when noise-canceling or spatial audio is turned on.

Overall, the Studio Pro are fantastic headphones for people who use both iOS and Android devices due to their compatibility with some of each operating system's native features. These headphones retail for $349, but you can regularly find them on sale, sometimes as low as $170.

**JBL Live 770NC tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth:** Yes (5.3) | **Battery life:** 40 hours (ANC off) | **Driver size:** 40mm dynamic | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Wired option(s):** USB-C, 3.5mm headphone jack

Pros

### Sennheiser Accentum Plus

#### Best mid-range headphones for casual listening

Sennheiser is known for its pro-grade audio products, but the higher-end products aren't suitable for everyone. If your friends in the audio space recommend you try a pair of Sennheiser cans, but you don't want to pay upwards of $600 to experience the company's iconic sound, try the Accentum Plus.

The Accentum Plus are the company's latest mid-range headphones that debuted at CES 2024\. The Accentum Plus have an incredibly clear and immersive sound for their price tag, offering detailed highs and punchy, deep bass. 

The Accentum Plus boast adaptive noise canceling, which I found wasn't the strongest, but helps keep your music center stage while keeping louder external noises at bay. These headphones are great for commuters, travelers, and desk workers, as they have a marathon battery life lasting over 50 hours.

**Review: [Sennheiser Accentum Plus](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-sennheisers-new-mid-range-headphones-and-theyre-so-close-to-perfect/)**

However, you must have the right head size to get the most out of these headphones. Maybe my head was too big, but when I tested the Accentum Plus, I couldn't wear them for more than an hour without my ears hurting. 

The Accentum Plus offers little style-wise, as their build is mostly plastic, uniform, and simple. The looks of these headphones won't start any conversations, but it's what's inside the earcups that matters with these cans.

Despite that, if you prefer wireless headphones but prioritize sound quality and want great sound for less than $250, the Accentum Plus will do you good.

**Sennheiser Accentum Plus tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth:** Yes (5.2) | **Battery life:** 60+ hours (ANC off) | **Driver size:** 40mm dynamic | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Wired option(s):** 3.5mm headphone jack

Pros 
* Marathon battery

* Spatial audio is a miss

### JBL Live 770NC

#### Best midrange headphones for everyday use

A pair of reliable headphones that can live inside your work or school bag is a must-have, and the JBL Live 770NC are a great option. These headphones are the latest upper-mid-range headphones from JBL, as the company announced them in January at CES. The Live 770NC include a laundry list of premium software features like wear detection, spatial audio, adaptive noise-canceling, and more. 

The Live 770NC's design and build materials are more premium than competitors at this price point, as JBL fitted the 770NC with big, plushy ear cups and a headband covered in soft fabric. When I tested the 770NC, I wore them for about five hours before I experienced any head or ear fatigue. 

**Review: [JBL Live 770NC](https://www.zdnet.com/article/jbls-latest-headphones-are-a-jack-of-all-trades-with-a-surprising-feature/)**

Sound-wise, the 770NC don't reproduce the most elevated sound I've heard, even within this $200 to $250 price range. Still, these headphones are more than suitable for casual listeners and people who want headphones solely to shield them from external noises.

The 770NC have adaptive noise-canceling, which means it adjusts based on the noise in your environment. This technology's adaptive aspect is very intuitive and effective, but the noise-canceling itself isn't anything to write home about.

Style-wise, the 770NC have an unassuming and simple design, free of colors, accents, or interesting design elements. However, the headphones' build is sturdy and premium-feeling despite their lower price point. If you prioritize getting as much bang for your buck over fancy design elements, the 770NC won't disappoint.

Overall, if you want new headphones that sound great, have a long battery life, are comfortable, and can get the job done all for less than $250, these are the way to go.

**JBL Live 770NC tech specs: Form factor:** Over-ear | **Bluetooth:** Yes (5.3) | **Battery life:** 60+ hours (ANC off) | **Driver size:** 40mm dynamic | **Noise cancellation:** Yes | **Wired option(s):** 3.5mm headphone jack

## Which headphones are right for you?

While all of these headphones are excellent picks, the choice ultimately depends on how much battery life you prefer, whether strong noise cancellation is important to you, your use cases, and how much you're willing to spend.

## Factors to consider when choosing a pair of headphones

I've spent many hours testing headphones, from big names like Sony and Bose to lesser-known brands, to show you that you have a sea of options. The headphones your best friend loves and recommends you try might be the worst headphones you've ever worn, which is why it's essential to consider these factors before you buy:

* **Battery life:** Nothing is worse than throwing on your headphones and seeing they're on 5% battery. If you often forget to charge your headphones, you'll want a pair with an extensive battery life. So, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra might not be your best option, but the JBL Live 770NC could work better for you.
* **Use cases:** There are many types of headphones, so you must ensure you're buying the right kind that matches your specific use cases. Perhaps your friend recommended the Sonos Ace headphones for their great sound, but you expected stronger noise-canceling -- a feature you anticipated, especially for the amount of money you spent. If you want headphones for commuting, make sure the headphones you're eyeing are suitable for that. If you need headphones to record your podcast, ensure you aren't purchasing headphones like the Sony XM5 over-ears.
* **Lifestyle headphones vs. audio-focused headphones:** I like to categorize headphones into these two categories. Lifestyle headphones are the headphones you see from brands like Bose, Apple, and Sony. However, brands like Sony and Sennheiser manufacture both lifestyle and audio-focused headphones. Lifestyle headphones can accompany you on your daily commute, to the office, and to the gym -- all on the same day. On the other hand, audio-focused headphones may lack the comfort, noise-canceling tech, and portability that lifestyle headphones possess since their primary use case is to examine audio critically.

## How we test headphones

The ZDNET team spends weeks with a pair of headphones to give you an informed opinion before you make a purchase. Here are [the benchmarks we use to test headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-headphones/).

* **Comfort and design:** We wear headphones for hours at a time to determine how long we can wear them before they become uncomfortable. We also test headphones across all budgets, meaning we test headphones made from inexpensive and more expensive materials to test durability.
* **Noise cancellation:** We wear noise-canceling headphones in various environments to test how well the technology performs in quieter and louder settings.
* **Sound quality:** Sound quality and sound profiles are highly subjective, as some people prefer heavier bass, while others prefer more pronounced treble. To give you the best idea about a pair of headphones' sound profile, we listen to them with different audio modes enabled. We also listen to headphones on various devices, like iPhones, Macs, Windows computers, tablets, and TVs, to listen for sound distinctions.
* **Battery life:** In rare cases, battery life deviates from a manufacturer's claim, and battery life varies depending on how you use a pair of headphones. To ensure a pair of headphones offers as much battery as advertised, we integrate the review unit into our daily lives by listening to music, taking calls, and enabling features like spatial audio.
* **Use cases:** No pair of headphones is a one-size-fits-all affair. Usually, headphones have a specific use case, whether for critical listening, watching TV, exercising, or canceling environmental noises. To determine which group of consumers will benefit the most from a pair of headphones, we test headphones in various use cases to specify their purpose.

## How do I choose the right headphones?

Before you buy a pair of headphones, there are a few things aside from price you should think about. A pair of headphones' form-factor, connectivity, and features are equally as important. If you're consulting this list, I'm assuming you've decided that you're not looking for [earbuds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-earbuds/). To help you out, think about if you want:

* **Wired or wireless (Bluetooth)?:** I recommend wired headphones for people who want to occasionally listen to music critically. Over a wired connection, you can access high-resolution music playback. If that doesn't matter to you and you'd rather have headphones that are portable and wire-free, you want wireless headphones. Fortunately, many consumer headphones can be wired or wireless, and many wireless headphones in this list can achieve high-resolution audio playback via a wired connection.
* **Closed-back or open-back?:** Closed-back headphones comprise most of the options on this list, and they're best for commuting and listening in public spaces. Because the back of the ear cups are closed, others around you hear less of your music and you hear less of others around you. If you want noise-canceling, then you want closed-back headphones. If you mix or master music, enjoy listening to music critically, or want to invest in higher-quality audio gear, consider open-back headphones.

## Should I buy on-ear or over-ear headphones?

I prefer [over-ear headphones](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-over-ear-headphones/) over on-ear headphones. As a result, I only recommended over-ear headphones in this list. On-ear headphones sit on your ears, while over-ear headphones cover your entire ear. Over-ear headphones create a better seal between your ears and the outside world, allowing for increased noise isolation.

Over-ear headphones provide a more immersive listening experience, and the tighter seal on your ears allows for increased noise-canceling performance.

However, you may like on-ear headphones if you want headphones with a more compact shape. If you don't like noise-canceling or prefer to better hear your surroundings, you should consider on-ear headphones.

## Should I buy earbuds or headphones?

The term "headphones" encompasses many types of listening devices, and earbuds are a type od headphone. However, for the sake of simplicity, let's conclude that earbuds are listening devices that go _inside_ your ears and headphones are listening devices that go _over_ your ears.

You should buy earbuds if:

* You don't want large, bulky headphones.
* You vigorously exercise frequently.

You should buy headphones if:

* You want longer battery life.
* You want better sound quality.
* You don't like objects inside your ears.

## Are there alternative headphones worth considering?

While the options listed above should get you pretty far, you might still be interested in alternative options. Here are a few of our other high-rated recommendations to consider.
