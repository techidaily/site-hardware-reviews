## Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon 12th Gen

### Best Lenovo laptop overall

Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon series has consistently had some of the company's best laptops, and that trend continues with the 12th generation Carbon. The stunning new 2.8K resolution OLED display supported by a wide array of image-enhancing software is a huge upgrade from the previous generation, making images and videos look nothing short of fantastic on this device. 

It supports the entire DCI-P3 gamut as well as HDR 500 for bright vivid colors and abyssal blacks. Plus, the screen's glass is covered in an anti-glare coating to maintain its high quality in bright environments.

**Review**: **[Lenovo's latest ThinkPad has new features that will make professionals jump for joy](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovos-latest-thinkpad-has-new-features-that-will-make-professionals-jump-for-joy/)**

The 12th generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon has an 8MP webcam on top of the screen, giving it the ability to shoot video in 4K resolution -- something not very many laptops can do. 

What's interesting (and a little funny) is that Lenovo finally listened to its user base by changing the location of the FN and Ctrl keys. It's a small change, but it reduces the chance you'll hit the wrong button while typing. Additionally, we recommend keeping the charger close by, as the battery drains pretty quickly. 

No matter how you look at it, however, the 12th generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon is a great machine that'll make just about anyone happy. 

**Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon tech specs** **:** **Processor:** Intel Core Ultra 7 155U | **Graphics Card:** Integrated Intel Graphics | **RAM:** 32GB | **Screen size:** 14 inches | **Operating system:** Windows 11 Pro | **Dimensions:** 12.3 x 0.6 x 8.5 inches

Pros 
* Great battery life
* Impressive performance
* Gorgeous 2K OLED display

Cons 
* On the heavier side
* Expensive

## Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i

### Best Lenovo laptop for business

The IdeaPad Pro 5i is a versatile 16-inch laptop, but its solid stack of hardware paired with the 2K OLED display makes it shine in the office. 

Under the hood, you'll find an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 graphics card, resulting in rock-solid performance. [We tested the hardware](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-laptops/) by running many common workplace tasks from web browsing to writing documents and video conferencing platforms simultaneously. It handled everything we threw at it without skipping a beat. 

**Review: [One of the longest-lasting laptops I've tested also has one of the best displays](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-longest-lasting-laptops-ive-tested-also-has-one-of-the-best-displays/)**

Additionally, it has 32GB of memory, ensuring load times are partially nonexistent. This hardware configuration even allows the IdeaPad Pro 5i to act as a capable gaming laptop, perfect for when you have those long days and want to relax with a game.

The IdeaPad Pro's generous heft allows for a full-sized keyboard, which, when paired with the rubber-like keycaps, results in a very comfortable typing experience. And lastly (but perhaps most importantly), the battery is quite good -- particularly for a laptop with an OLED display -- lasting almost nine hours straight during our livestream video test. 

**Lenovo IdeaPad Pro 5i tech specs** **:** **Processor:** Intel Core Ultra 9 | **Graphics Card:** Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 | **RAM:** 32GB | **Screen size:** 16 inches | **Operating system:** Windows 11 Pro | **Dimensions:** 14.02 x 9.88 x 0.69 inches

## Lenovo Yoga Slim 7x

### Best ultraportable Lenovo laptop

Lenovo is well-known for developing some of the [best ultraportable laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-lightweight-laptops/) out there. Among its many lightweight models, the new, aptly-named Yoga Slim 7x stands out as a powerful option that's exceedingly portable. It features a sleek, matte cobalt blue form factor that exudes premium, a truly brilliant OLED display, and a 70Wh battery that defies expectations.

As one of Lenovo's first [Copilot+ PCs](https://www.zdnet.com/article/every-copilot-pc-microsoft-just-announced-to-take-on-apples-m3-macbooks/) with the new Windows on ARM Snapdragon X Elite processor, the Slim 7x is certainly one of the most performant laptops on this list, while also being one of the lightest. The processor allows for snappy, efficient performance that is powerful enough to handle a variety of use cases, while the OLED display looks fantastic, and can get up to 1,000 nits bright for peak HDR content. 

**Review: [I'm a hybrid worker, and my laptop of choice is not a MacBook or a Dell](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-work-hybrid-and-my-laptop-of-choice-is-not-a-macbook-or-a-dell/)**

We recently went [hands-on with the Slim 7x](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-work-hybrid-and-my-laptop-of-choice-is-not-a-macbook-or-a-dell/) and praised its overall premium, professional feel, particularly as a machine for remote or hybrid workers, as its 2.82-pound body makes it well-suited for commuting. Under the hood, it doesn't have the most memory or storage on this list (a factor that keeps its price point accessible) but the next-gen processor drives its impressive performance. 

**Lenovo ThinkPad Z13 Gen 2 AMD tech specs:** **Processor:** Snapdragon X Elite X1E-78-100 Processor | **RAM:** 16GB | **Screen size:** 14.5 inches | **Operating system:** Windows 11 Pro | **Dimensions:** 12.80 x 8.86 x as thin as 0.51 inches

## Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 9

### Best Lenovo gaming laptop

Among Lenovo's slew of gaming laptops, the 9th-generation Legion Pro 7i gets crowned as champion. This machine is not the most portable, weighing a heavy 6 lbs. But what you get is worth the extra heft. 

This machine is ready to be a gamer's best friend. Under the hood is a 14th-generation Intel Core i9-14900HX processor paired with a GeForce RTX 4080 graphics card and 32 GB of memory. Plus, it has a 2TB SSD to go along with everything. The Legion Pro 7i is a beast. It's a monster capable of running all of the latest games in ultra-high resolution and a high frame rate without skipping a beat.

**Also: [The best gaming laptops of 2024: Get your game on](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-gaming-laptop/)**

There are various ports on the rear and around the side of the laptop. You have your standard fair like USB-C inputs and a headphone jack. But you also get an ethernet port for wired internet access as well as an HDMI input for connecting the computer to a monitor. Lenovo also gave its device the AI Engine Plus software to help boost performance when you need it. 

Speaking from experience, a laptop like this can run hot, and heat can destroy internal components. So, the company equipped their machine with a robust cooling system to keep things running at an optimal temperature. And if that wasn't enough, it contains speakers powerful enough to fill a room with immersive audio.

**Lenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 9 tech specs:** **Processor:** 14th generation Intel Core i9-14900HX Processor | **Graphics Card:** Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080| **RAM:** 32GB | **Screen size:** 16 inches | **Operating system:** Windows 11 | **Dimensions:** 14.03 x 10.32 x 1.01 inches

## 2024 Lenovo Yoga 9i

### Best 2-in-1 Lenovo laptop

Similar to the ThinkPad X1 Carbon, Lenovo's Yoga 9i 2-in-1 laptop takes the series and what made it so beloved by users into a bold new direction with new hardware plus a slimmer design. Inside the latest model is the Meteor Lake processor: the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H for next-gen performance. It's paired with a stunning OLED display which we refer to as its "shining jewel."

The screen has a near 3K resolution and a refresh rate of 120Hz. This level of speed is particularly noteworthy because it ensures smooth video playback and cursor movement. What's more, the touchscreen is supported by multiple image-enhancing software such as Dolby Vision for high visual fidelity.

**Review**: [**Lenovo's latest 2-in-1 laptop wowed me with clever design and a bold outlook**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/lenovos-latest-2-in-1-laptop-wowed-me-with-clever-design-and-a-bold-outlook/)

Another interesting aspect of the Yoga 9i is its design. Lenovo made a lot of great choices here. First off, it looks great. Interested buyers can purchase the laptop in a Cosmic Blue that comes with polished metal on the sides and thin bezels for an eye-catching design. It's also slimmer than the previous model clocking in a little under 3 lbs, yet its frame is made out of durable aluminum. 

Each of the keys has a travel distance of 1.5mm for a springy feel when typing. This reduces the amount of strain on your fingers so you'll ultimately have a better time with the laptop. And that's what it's all about; having a good time with your device. The Yoga 9i delivers on this front in spades.

**Lenovo Yoga 9i tech specs: Processor:** Intel Core Ultra 7 155H | **RAM:** 16GB | **Screen size:** 14 inches | **Operating system:** Windows 11 | **Dimensions:** 0.65 x 8.58 x 12.4 inches

Pros 
* Inexpensive
* High quality display
* Solid battery life

Cons 
* Flimsy construction
* Can run hot

## Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i Chromebook Plus

### Best Lenovo laptop for students

Rounding out the list is Lenovo's IdeaPad Flex 5i. It's a member of the recently released Chromebook Plus line, a series of Chromebooks from various manufacturers sporting more powerful hardware compared to older models. 

Every single one is a great pick, however Lenovo's option stands out from the rest by having one of the best displays. It outputs a resolution of 1,920 x 1,200 pixels, and thanks to its flexible hinge, can be turned 180 degrees. This turns the laptop into a tablet, which goes great with the AI-powered editing features on board, like Magic Eraser.

**Review: [This $499 Lenovo Chromebook Plus will make you reconsider spending so much on laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-499-lenovo-chromebook-plus-will-make-you-reconsider-spending-so-much-on-laptops/)**

Even if you're not a photographer, we still recommend the IdeaPad Flex 5i for everyday work. Its 13th-Gen Intel Core i3 processor delivers great performance for a computer of its caliber. Plus, the keyboard is fantastic. It's wide with large keys allowing for comfortable typing. Lenovo's 2-in-1 Chromebook is also lightweight, clocking in at 3.5lbs. And the best part: It's cheap. Prices fluctuate, but we haven't seen it go for more than $500.

There are a couple of issues with it; namely, it can get hot. At high temperatures, typing on the IdeaPad can be uncomfortable. But for the price and performance, this isn't a deal-breaker.

**Lenovo IdeaPad Flex 5i tech specs: Processor:** 13th-Gen Intel Core i3-1315U | **Graphics Card:** Integrated Intel UHD Graphics Card| **RAM:** 8GB| **Screen size:** 14-inch 1,920 x 1,200 pixel resolution touchscreen| **Operating system:** Chrome OS | **Dimensions:** 0.8 x 12.4 x 9 inches

## How does Lenovo compare to other top brands?

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

As the competition to produce higher-performing laptops at ever-competitive price points heats up, different brands have embraced their reputations and specialized offerings to set themselves apart. We've tested machines from all of the top brands out there, and can safely say there are certain things brands do better than others. So where does Lenovo stand? Let's take a look. 

### Lenovo vs. Dell

Lenovo is known for its utilitarian, durable design philosophy, particularly with its iconic ThinkPad line of laptops. They're robust and versatile, and have a reputation for being workhorses, especially in the office. By contrast, Dell is known for some rather innovative designs. The[Dell XPS 14](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-dells-2024-xps-14-laptop-and-cant-recommend-it-enough/), for example, is a powerful laptop, but visually daring with its flush keyboard, "InfinityEdge" display, and invisible trackpad.

Many Lenovo laptops are designed for the enterprise space, and as such exude a conservative, "down to business" element. Dell laptops on the other hand, are very versatile and marketed toward a broad range of consumers from creators to businesses to home use.

### Lenovo vs. Apple

Apple needs no introduction when it comes to brand aesthetics. Its minimalist, sleek design is evident in all of its products, and users still see Apple at the forefront of innovation. Its MacBook line of laptops are some of the highest-performing laptops on the market, and they compete in processing power with even the highest-tier Windows machines. 

Lenovo's reputation as a reliable brand is reinforced with its dependable line of laptops, and its approach to innovation is a bit more subtle. Nevertheless, some of Lenovo's newest devices, like the sleek [Yoga Slim 7x](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-dell-inspiron-is-one-of-the-most-versatile-well-rounded-laptops-ive-tested/), feel like they could have taken a page out of the MacBook's design book.

### Lenovo vs. HP

HP's line of laptops reach a broad range of consumers, from budget machines to high-end laptops like the new [OmniBook X 14](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-the-most-portable-work-laptops-ive-tested-isnt-a-lenovo-or-macbook-and-its-200-off/). Lenovo laptops put an emphasis on innovation and durability -- particularly in a business context -- while HP laptops tend to target consumers seeking a balance with affordability and function, as well as strong displays and familiar branding. 

**Also: [The 2-in-1 laptop I recommend most is not a Lenovo or Dell (and it's cheaper than ever)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ive-tested-dozens-of-2-in-1-laptops-this-one-hits-all-the-right-marks/)**

### Lenovo vs. Microsoft

Microsoft's latest [Surface Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-tablet-i-recommend-most-for-work-travel-is-not-an-ipad-or-thinkpad/) attracted lots of attention this year for its innovative, 2-in-1 form factor, something Lenovo has been doing with its Yoga line of laptops. If you're looking for a convertible laptop/tablet device, both brands offer solid choices, with Microsoft's machine at the cutting edge of design and form.

The [Microsoft Surface Laptop](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tried-microsofts-new-surface-laptop-copilot-pc-and-it-beat-my-macbook-air-in-3-ways/) is also a sleek, high-performing laptop for creators, business users, and home use alike, and one that we praised earlier this year for its versatility and AI readiness. 

## How we test laptops

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

We use a combination of methods to test laptops here at ZDNET. First, we acquire data from benchmarking software to analyze a system's metrics under the hood, and compare those to advertised numbers. Then, we spend an extended amount of time with the laptop (usually a week or two) using it the same way a normal consumer would, in order to analyze its portability, form factor, and how well the battery _actually_ holds up, among others. For an extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive [laptop testing methodology](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-laptops/).

* **Benchmarking:** First, we run a series of tests to put the computer's hardware through the wringer in order to see what it's capable of. [Cinebench](https://www.maxon.net/en/downloads/cinebench-2024-downloads) is one of the most commonly-used hardware testing suites, which tests the laptop's rendering performance on single and multiple CPU cores. [PCMark 10](https://benchmarks.ul.com/pcmark10) is another powerful program that covers a wide variety of tasks performed in the workplace, and there are many others that we use in tandem to gather as much data as we can. Some components we run tests on include:
* **Processor:** The "brain" of the laptop, and one of the most important factors that determines performance. The four biggest manufacturers that make most of the CPUs found in laptops today are Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple (in their own machines only). This is tested in benchmarking software.
* **The display:** The size of the display (measured diagonally from corner to corner) is also what dictates the laptop's overall size, and play a big role in the laptop's cost. Brightness is measured in "nits," and color spectrums are tested in benchmarking software.
* **The graphics processor (GPU):** Whether it's integrated into the CPU or a dedicated graphics card, how well the machine handles graphics is a key factor when it comes to demanding visual tasks like video editing, rendering, and of course, gaming. We test the GPU with a combination of benchmarking software, gaming, and media playback.
* **Physical form factor:** Finally, the laptop's overall appearance and physical form factor encompasses its weight, thickness, how the keyboard and trackpad feel, and whether or not it has a display that can be folded back to form a tablet. We carry the laptop around for at least a week and note how well it commutes.
* **Battery testing:** We test a unit's battery in a few ways. A handful of benchmarking programs have their own battery testing components, but we also will just let the laptop run for as long as it can under a medium load. We ensure screensavers and hibernation mode are turned off, set the display's brightness and audio at 50%, load up a livestream on YouTube in Chrome, and wait 'til the end.
* **The human element:**  As we mentioned earlier, metrics and system data is important, but numbers alone don't give you the full picture. This is where we weave in our personal experience with the device and tap into the practical use cases that consumers actually care about.

Ultimately, our goal is to break down the capabilities of each and every laptop we test into digestible terms that real people can find useful. There is a lot of noise and confusion when it comes to navigating the laptop and computer consumer market, so we hope to bring an intuitive element to the whole process by leveraging our team's decades of experience. 

## Choosing the right Lenovo Laptop

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

Lenovo makes a wide array of laptops covering all sorts of use cases. You won't be left wanting more choices. As we established, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon is the king of the hill. But that does not necessarily mean it's the best one for you. The best Lenovo laptop ultimately comes down to what you, the user, are looking for. We can help with that with the suggestions down below.

## Factors to consider when choosing a Lenovo laptop

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

There are multiple factors to consider when picking out the best Lenovo laptop, including:

* **Form factor:** Laptops come in an array of form factors these days, be it a traditional clamshell or a 2-in-1 convertible design like the Yoga 9i. Convertible laptops generally give you greater flexibility and portability, but they can lack some features available on more traditional laptops. Other laptops (like the ThinkPad X1 Extreme) fold completely flat but won't go all the way back into a tablet form.
* **Size:** If you plan to take your Lenovo laptop on the go, you'll want a smaller build for portability. It's important to be mindful of the display size as it directly affects the overall dimensions of a laptop, however, a smaller display doesn't necessarily mean lighter. The Lenovo Slim 7x, for example, features a 14.5-inch display, but is less than an inch thick and weighs only 2.82 pounds.
* **CPU:** A laptop's processor gives you an idea of how fast a laptop will work. Lenovo classifies its laptops by Core categories, with the Core i9 and Core i7 being the more powerful processors. The Slim 7x features the cutting-edge Snapdragon X Elite chip that runs Windows on ARM, an emerging technology.
* **Graphics:** Consider the type of graphics card available with your laptop. If you are a gamer or video editor, a strong GPU is an important feature to consider. Be sure to look for a laptop with a powerful integrated graphics or an advanced graphics card to suit your needs.
* **Battery:** It's important to know the battery life of a new Lenovo laptop. If you spend a lot of time traveling, you may need a laptop with longer battery life so you are not constantly fumbling for a charger.

## FAQs regarding Lenovo laptops

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

### How do I care for my new Lenovo laptop?

A new laptop is an investment, and making it last is essential to maximizing its value. To care for your new laptop, you'll want to minimize the amount of bumps and vibrations it's exposed to, and keep it closed when not in use to protect the keys and screen, which can be fragile. 

Maximizing your laptop's battery life is also part of its longevity, as it's best to keep it between 30% and 80% to optimize battery life. Besides these obvious factors, you'll want to keep the software and drivers up to date, and get a backpack and sleeve for safe, efficient transport. 

### How long does the battery typically last?

Battery life depends on a variety of different factors, such as what kinds of tasks you're doing and whether your computer is in a battery-saving mode or high-performance mode. Lenovo laptops are known for having solid batteries, particularly the ThinkPad and IdeaPad line of devices. 

**Also: [I'm a hybrid worker, and my laptop of choice is not a MacBook or a Dell](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-work-hybrid-and-my-laptop-of-choice-is-not-a-macbook-or-a-dell/)**

When looking at a laptop's battery, take into account its watt hour number (written as Wh), which measures how much power a battery uses over one hour. The higher the number, the longer the battery should theoretically be able to last; however, how fast the computer burns through that power is another story.

For example, the Legion Pro7i features a 99Wh battery, but the powerful hardware on board will demand lots of power from the battery. Conversely, the 70Wh battery in the Yoga Slim 7x will drain at a trickle in comparison thanks to the AI on board the Snapdragon X Elite processor.

### Which Lenovo laptop is most durable?

Lenovo's ThinkPad series of laptops is regarded as some of the most durable laptops on the market for their sturdy, well-built design and unpretentious form factors. They're also known to be more repair-friendly than many other computers, as you can replace parts with relative ease. 

**Also: [This Lenovo laptop is ultraportable, lasts all day, and has a MagSafe-like superpower](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-13-inch-laptop-ive-tested-in-2024-is-not-by-apple-or-microsoft/)**

Regarding the laptops on this list, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon and X1 Extreme are made from partially-recycled magnesium, aluminum, and carbon fiber, and have been MIL-STD 810H certified in torture tests against travel hazards like shock, vibration, and extreme temperatures.

### Can you game on a Lenovo laptop?

You can game on any Lenovo laptop, but you're going to get the best performance from a computer that's designed for gaming like the Lenovo Legion 5 Pro. The reason for this has a lot to do with graphics processing and whether or not the device is designed to mitigate heat well. 

**Also: [This Lenovo 2-in-1 is one of the most versatile business laptops I've tested](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-lenovo-2-in-1-is-one-of-the-most-versatile-business-laptops-ive-tested/)**

Most Lenovo laptops are fine for casual or entry-level gaming, but once you start running graphically-intense games, you're going to run into performance issues, and the laptop will not be able to compensate for the heat generated by the hardware. 

Lenovo's own gaming options come with dedicated graphics cards, high refresh rate displays, and a robust cooling system. However, if you truly want the [best gaming laptop](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-gaming-laptop/), there are a host of other options out there, especially for demanding games. Check out the [Razer Blade 15](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB08FCRBQV3%2F%3Fth%3D1%26tag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C5ed4510e-c519-4d78-99d7-3d2a22b01a01%7Cdtp&dtb=1), for example, or a desktop computer.

### How do you access the BIOS on a Lenovo laptop?

Restart your computer, and when the Lenovo startup screen appears, you'll want to press either F1, F2, or Enter, depending on your model. It will often specify on the screen, but note that this screen may only appear for a second or two before Windows starts up. 

## How much does a Lenovo laptop cost?

The cost of the best Lenovo laptop can vary. Again, it depends on the model you choose. The best Lenovo laptop overall is the 12th-Gen Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon, which costs a little over $1,600\. However, if you have more to spend, you can find more premium options closer to $2,000 a pop. Inexpensive options, like the IdeaPad Flex 5i, are way cheaper. That model retails for around $500.

## Where do I buy a Lenovo laptop?

Lenovo laptops are available for purchase directly from the company's official website, but that isn't your only option. Many digital retailers sell Lenovo laptops on their platforms. However, make sure the website is legitimate before you buy. There are a lot of scams out there.

We recommend going to either Amazon, Walmart, or Best Buy as your first stop in the buying process. For added convenience, we've provided shopping links in each of the entries to save you time buying the best Lenovo laptop.

## Other Lenovo laptops we've tested

Lenovo makes several kinds of laptops under different series, from the ThinkPad and Legion lines. The ones above are the best as we've established, but there are others that almost made the cut. The three below are worthy of a second look.

**Also:** [**The best Windows laptops**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-windows-laptop/)
