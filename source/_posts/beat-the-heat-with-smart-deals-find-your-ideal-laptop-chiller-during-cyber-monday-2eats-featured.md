Laptops are a lot cooler than they used to be, but if you push them hard doing heavyweight tasks like gaming or video editing, or sometimes even when backing up, they can still get toasty warm.

If the laptop is on a desk, this heat could be shortening the life of the laptop. If it's on your lap, well, let's just say that things can get awfully uncomfortable.

[You need a laptop cooler.](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop-cooling-pad/)

There are two things that people want from a good laptop cooler -- it needs to actually cool the laptop, and it shouldn't be deafening when they are working (some are truly awful to be near when working!).

Here are two quality laptop coolers that you can pick up for less in the Cyber Monday sales. One is perfect for general use, the other for gamers or those looking for something colorful and stylish!
