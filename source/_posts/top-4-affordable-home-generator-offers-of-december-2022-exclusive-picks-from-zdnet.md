When shopping for a portable generator, make sure you know how many watts you'll need to run things like lights, phone chargers, and electric ranges, then add around 10 percent to ensure that there will be enough energy to go around.

It also features a fuel switch so you can flip between gas and propane as needed, and it makes running the engine empty for storage faster. With a low oil shut-off and idle control mode, the generator automatically shuts off when there isn't enough oil in the engine, preventing damage while also reducing noise and fuel consumption -- which is great news for residential use.

## What kind of generator is best for home use?

If you're looking to set up your house to go off-grid and be entirely self-sufficient, you'll want to install a home standby generator. These types of generators are permanent installations, designed to work with a solar panel array or wind turbines to provide consistent power on cloudy or windless days as well as at night. 

If you want to make sure you have electricity for at-home medical equipment and appliances during a weather emergency, a portable or inverter generator is your best option. If you do opt for a portable or inverter generator, you'll need to make sure you get one with more than enough wattage to run everything. Lowe's has a [handy worksheet](https://www.lowes.com/pdf/portable%5Fgenerator%5Fwattage%5Fchart.pdf) available, so you won't accidentally burn up your fridge.

## How do you hook a generator to your house?

Home standby generators require licensed technicians to properly install. And even portable generators need proper preparation before you can attempt to power your whole house with one. You should never plug a portable generator directly into your home's electrical system without first having a technician install a transfer switch. 

Without a transfer switch, you could overload your home's wiring, causing fires, short-outs, and all kinds of other damage. If you intend to use a portable or inverter generator to run just a few appliances, make sure to read the operating manual thoroughly before plugging anything in.

## How long do generators last?

A typical gasoline or dual fuel generator can last up to 2,000 hours with proper engine maintenance. Portable generators aren't meant to run continuously for an indefinite period of time, but you can have one going for one to two days during an emergency, as long as you have enough fuel. 

Home standby generators are much more robust, having lifetimes upwards of 40 years. No matter which kind you choose for your home, proper engine maintenance is a must. Make sure that all air, oil, and fuel filters are regularly changed as well as regularly changing the oil itself, and you'll be able to keep your generator at optimal efficiency for quite some time.
