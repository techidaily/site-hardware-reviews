### Why this deal is ZDNET recommended

The [M3 MacBook Pro](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5JLWJK%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C7a70ff61-71b8-4921-9004-1804f0e608d8%7Cdtp&dtb=1) is perfect for professionals and creatives looking for a high-end laptop that can tackle powerful graphics workloads with ease. If you've had your eye on a MacBook with Apple's newest processor, or are looking to upgrade your existing machine, now would be the perfect time to spring into action. 

Armed with 14.2-inch display capable of getting up to 1000 nits (that's very bright), the M3 MacBook Pro handles seamless multitasking, video and photo editing, and 4K video playback all in a portable form factor. 

[Apple M3 MacBook Pro (save $200) $1,399 at Amazon](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0CM5JLWJK%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7C7a70ff61-71b8-4921-9004-1804f0e608d8%7Cdtp&dtb=1)

The base M3 MacBook Pro 14-inch comes with an 8‑core CPU, 10‑core GPU, 8GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for a regular price of $1,599, but currently on sale for $1,399.

If you really want to go to the top of the line with the M3 MacBook Pro, the 12-core CPU, 18-core GPU with the 16-inch display is also on sale for $200 off, down to $2,299 from a regular price of $2,499.

Speaking of the processor, the latest M3 chip is a 50% performance boost from the M1 models, and 11 times the performance of the fastest Intel-based MacBook Pros. This makes the MacBook Pro 14-inch and 16-inch models the go-to laptops for creatives like graphic designers, 3D animators, video editors, and professionals that need the reliable power of a desktop machine paired with portability.

The M3 MacBook Pro also comes stacked with ports, including an HDMI, SDXC card slot, two Thunderbolt USB 4 ports, a MagSafe port and headphone jack. These laptops also support fast wireless connectivity with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, making swapping between different Bluetooth devices like your phone and your AirPods seamless and lightning-fast. 

In addition, with up to 22 hours of battery life, the M3 improves on previous versions of the line with power-efficient design that isn't going to stay battery-starved.
