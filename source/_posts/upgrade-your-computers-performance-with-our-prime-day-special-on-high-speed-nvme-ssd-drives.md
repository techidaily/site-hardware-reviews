## Upgrade Your Computer's Performance with Our Prime Day Special on High-Speed NVMe SSD Drives!

In the day and age when individual games regularly weigh in at over 100GB, phone cameras take enormous photos, and our lives are increasingly digital, there really isn't such a thing as too much storage. If you're looking to upgrade your storage speed and capacity, this is the deal for you.

[NVMe Solid-State Drives (SSDs)](https://digital-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-audio-capture-for-post-review/) are the latest and greatest in storage technology, can [easily be 10x faster than a SATA SSD](https://techno-recovery.techidaily.com/accelerate-windows-1n-1-effective-solutions-for-enhancing-system-speed-and-responsiveness/), and now often sit at a better price point than their SATA cousins.

 Western Digital's Black SN850x comes in three size variants: 1TB, 2TB, and 4TB. The highest capacity model, the 4TB variant, has a normal MSRP of $600 but is currently marked down to _$259_. That is only about $65 per terabyte, which is a better value proposition than most SATA SSDs you can buy. The lower capacity models are marked down by about 30% each.

 What do you do with so much speedy storage? Whatever you want!

 NVMe drives are all incredibly fast, and the WD Black 850x is among the fastest PCIe 4.0 drives out there, with read speeds up to 7.3GB/s and write speeds around 6.6GB/s. The drive works with [Microsoft's DirectStorage technology](https://android-location.techidaily.com/3-effective-methods-to-fake-gps-location-on-android-for-your-lava-yuva-3-drfone-by-drfone-virtual/), which helps reduce load times in games, and would be a great option for anyone that has to regularly manipulate or move large files, such as artists or other content creators. It is also compatible with Playstations, if you're looking to upgrade your console's storage. You could also stick it in [an external enclosure](https://amazon.com/dp/B0CVNPMR4Q?tag=htgprimedaysite-20) if you want an incredibly fast external SSD to take with you on the road.

 I'll be putting mine to use [running virtual machines](https://remote-screen-capture.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-guide-video-recording-with-vlc/). At any given time, I'll have virtual machines for [a few major Linux distros](https://youtube-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-efficiently-balancing-professional-commitments-and-creativity/), a couple of [insider channels for Windows 11](https://program-issues.techidaily.com/boosting-horizon-zero-dawns-speed-tips-for-higher-fps-and-superior-play-experience/), and a standard Windows 10 virtual machine. Those use up a ton of space, and since [the performance of a virtual machine largely depends on your drive's speed](https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-next-level-gameplay-leading-monitors-for-ps5-with-hdmi-21-features/), a 4TB NVMe drive was a no-brainer.
