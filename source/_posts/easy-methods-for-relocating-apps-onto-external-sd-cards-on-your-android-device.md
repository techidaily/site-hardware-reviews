 Some Android phones don't have a lot of storage, which means you might run out of space for apps. If your device has a microSD card slot, you can use that to expand the storage and have more room for apps. However, SD card support is more limited than it used to be.

##  What You Need to Know

 Android apps are installed on your device's internal storage by default. If you have a [microSD card](https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-microSDXC-Expanded-MB-MD128KA-AM/dp/B09B1G89YQ?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU222610&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2F114667%2Fhow-to-install-android-apps-to-the-sd-card-by-default-move-almost-any-app-to-the-sd-card%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Short-Term), you can move some of your currently installed apps over to the microSD card. This is not supported by all apps, however. In fact, many don't support this feature at all.

 The state of SD card support on Android is a shell of what it used to be. Not only is it much harder to find Android devices with SD card slots, but the functionality has been greatly diminished as well. We'll show you what you might be able to do if you have a microSD card in your Android device.

 Running an app off your SD card will almost always be slower than running it off the internal storage, so only use this if you absolutely have to—and if you can, try to use it for apps that don't require a lot of speed to run well.

##  Can You Install Apps Directly to the SD Card?

 Some manufacturers—namely, Samsung and LG—allowed users to format microSD cards as internal storage prior to around 2022\. That meant apps and games would be installed there by default. Sadly, this feature is no longer present on newer devices.

 Technically, it's still possible if you're willing to go through the trouble of rooting your Android phone. Rooting an Android phone is [not as worth it as it used to be](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/new-grasping-the-basics-of-telegram-marketing-strategies/). Android has gotten much better and the rooting process has only gotten more difficult. It's simply not a legitimate solution for the majority of people.

 Sadly, not many Android phones have SD card slots anymore, and it seems that even fewer apps support the ability to be moved to external storage. If you do have an SD card slot, you should take [advantage of it](https://apple-account.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-apple-id-from-your-apple-iphone-6-without-security-questions-by-drfone-ios/).
