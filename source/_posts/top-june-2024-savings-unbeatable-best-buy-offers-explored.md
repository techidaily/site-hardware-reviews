## Top 9 Unbeatable Gaming Laptop Offers in February 2023 - Explore the Best Picks

Between chip shortages and the crypto mining craze, buying a pre-built gaming laptop is the fastest way to get your hands on a new GPU, especially if you want the latest options from vendors including Nvidia.

Gaming laptops tend to be pricey because they demand top graphics cards -- often containing one or two -- high-end processors, strong connectivity features, and quality displays. Together, the cost of these components packaged up in a laptop's chassis means that consumers often feel the sting.

## How did we choose these laptops?

When researching the best gaming laptop deals, we considered various factors, including tech specs and price points. While every gamer would no doubt love to have the newest and most powerful machines, chip shortages can impact availability. Plus, affordability can be a deciding factor -- especially with the uncertainty of the global economy.

## What defines a gaming laptop?

Gaming laptops are designed to run power-hungry applications. These include gaming services, dedicated platforms like Steam, and individual games loaded onto a PC. 

The specifications of a gaming laptop focus on several things: a high-power display with a decent refresh rate and resolution, dedicated graphics cards, quality processors, and a fair amount of storage. They may also have keyboards and other peripherals included that are designed with gaming functionality in mind, whether by the way of backlighting or programmable keys. 

## What specifications are the most important in a gaming laptop?

The first consideration is whether or not a laptop has the right specs to run your software. Many games will come with a recommended specifications list on PCs, and out of these, the processor, RAM (memory), and graphics card capabilities are the most important.

## What else do I need when I buy a gaming laptop?

You might want to consider purchasing [a gaming mouse](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-gaming-mouse/), as it can be programmed to perform specific actions based on your clicks. Plus, they can make gaming a more enjoyable experience -- or, as is the case for speedruns, make those important actions as fast as possible. 

You may also want to investigate [comfortable gaming headsets](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/best-gaming-headset/) for a more immersive experience.
