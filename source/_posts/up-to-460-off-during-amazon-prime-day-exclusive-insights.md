Best Buy

As Hannah Montana once said, "you get the best of both worlds." That statement couldn't be more evident than it is with this [Microsoft Surface Pro 8](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Pro-8-13-Touchscreen%2Fdp%2FB09DK7ZWMP%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce3d605be-5def-422d-8d7f-e46264931e16%7Cdtp&dtb=1). This Microsoft Surface doubles as both a laptop and tablet with a kickstand, detachable keyboard, and a smart pen to solidify its spot as one of the best laptops on the market.

With an Intel i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM, and a 256 GB SSD, this computer can complete any task in incredible time. Did I mention that this Surface Pro 8 has Windows 11 as well?

Though this deal is valid for the graphite device only, you can purchase the [detachable keyboard](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Pro-Signature-Keyboard%2Fdp%2FB09DKCMZFK%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce3d605be-5def-422d-8d7f-e46264931e16%7Cdtp&dtb=1) and [pen](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMetapen-Microsoft-Surface-VivoBook-Students%2Fdp%2FB0B1CS1XK2%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce3d605be-5def-422d-8d7f-e46264931e16%7Cdtp&dtb=1) on Amazon for $150 and $21 respectively. But, if you wanted to purchase the [Platinum-colored Surface Pro 8](https://buy.geni.us/Proxy.ashx?TSID=368250&GR%5FURL=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Pro-8-13-Touchscreen%2Fdp%2FB09DJSF748%2F%3Ftag%3Dzd-buy-button-20%26ascsubtag%3D%5F%5FCOM%5FCLICK%5FID%5F%5F%7Ce3d605be-5def-422d-8d7f-e46264931e16%7Cdtp&dtb=1), you can purchase that for just $30 more than this model.
