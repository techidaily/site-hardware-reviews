Just as the new year officially hits full swing, so are the deals and savings. Best Buy is jumping into the deals for tech right now to help you score the best deals so far in 2023\.

And, if you are looking for more options across other retailers, we also keep tabs on [Amazon](https://www.zdnet.com/article/amazon-deals/) and [Walmart](https://www.zdnet.com/article/walmart-deals/), so you can also check out the best deals currently across those retailers, too.
