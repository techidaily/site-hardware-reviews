 Android can be used in many different languages, but the system language is applied to everything. What if you only want to use certain apps in another language? Android also allows you to choose language on a per-app basis.

 Some Android apps include the ability to change languages in their own settings. [Starting in Android 13](https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/from-freelance-filmmaker-to-full-time-financier-snapchat-storytelling-for-2024/), this can be done from the system settings, but only if the app supports language selection. We'll show you how it works on Samsung Galaxy and Pixel devices.

 As mentioned, this feature is only available with Android 13 (also known as [One UI 5 on Samsung Galaxy devices](https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/how-to-watch-the-star-trek-movies-in-order/)). Devices with older versions can only change the system language.
