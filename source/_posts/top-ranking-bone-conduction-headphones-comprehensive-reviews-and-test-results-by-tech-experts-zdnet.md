## Top-Ranking Bone Conduction Headphones : Comprehensive Reviews & Test Results by Tech Experts | ZDNet

As you train for marathon season, I recommend using bone conduction headphones for all your music-playing needs.

But bone conduction headphones aren't just useful for running -- they're great for intense workouts, outdoor walks, and even swimming.

Many outdoor runners attribute the open-ear design to increased environmental awareness and safety from cars. You'll still feel every beat and hear every detail of your music, podcast, or audiobook. If you're going all-in on your fitness goals this summer, training for that marathon, or want to listen to music as you swim laps in the pool or hike up a mountain, bone conduction headphones could be your rugged fitness companion.

### Shokz OpenRun Pro

#### Best bone conduction headphones overall

Unlike earlier iterations of bone conduction headphones, the Shokz OpenRun Pro skip the in-ear buds design without jeopardizing audio quality and clarity, digging into a premium headphone at a not-too-shabby pricepoint. Thanks to Shokz TurboPitch engineering and Shokz ninth bone conduction technology, our testing concluded that safer running no longer has an ample sound tradeoff with these headphones. 

ZDNET contributor Matthew Miller tried out the OpenRun Pro headset, and lauded the "lightweight, comfortable, and durable" design, and noted how little discomfort or pressure he felt while wearing and exercising with the headset. And users agree: As one Best Buy customer and OpenRun Pro owner put it, "This headphone is a unique audio marvel that superbly combines technology, design, and comfort."

**Review:** **[Shokz OpenRun Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/shokz-openrun-pro-review/)**

To help them stay in place during your workout, Shokz includes a headband with your bone conduction headphones. The titanium frame simply wraps around your head for a lightweight fit that is easy to wear when you are most active.

**Shokz OpenRun Pro tech specs: Type:** Open ear | **Wired/wireless:** Wireless **| Waterproof rating:** IP55 | **Weight:** 1.02 ounces | **Battery life:** 10 hours | **Dimensions:** 6.61 x 5.35 x 2.64 inches

### Philips Go A7607

#### Best bone conduction headphones for outdoor listening

Bring these bone conduction headphones to the office for your conference calls and then take them right to the gym for a weight-lifting session or on an outdoor run afterwardâ€”they're that versatile. They have an IP66 rating, making them water-resistant and sweatproof, and their open-ear form factor makes them a great choice for someone who wants to be as aware of their surroundings as they are immersed in the content they're streaming. 

ZDNET editor Jada Jones switched from AirPods to the Phillips Go A7607 while going on outdoor walks. She [reports](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-these-bone-conduction-headphones-are-my-go-to-for-outdoor-listening/) that they not only give her more peace of mind as a young woman walking alone but also deliver groove-able audio that gets "plenty loud." Amazon reviewers also complimented the headphones' waterproof rating and long battery life. 

**Review:** [**Philips Go A7607**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-these-bone-conduction-headphones-are-my-go-to-for-outdoor-listening/)

These headphones are made for athletes and fitness junkies, with a few subtle features that make them a match for any outdoor exercise obsessive. The neckband integrates a bright red LED light that helps you stay visible to cars and people if you prefer to exercise at night.

**Philips Go A7607 tech specs: Type:** Open ear **| Wired/wireless:** Wireless | **Waterproof rating:** IP66 | **Weight:** 1.3 ounces | **Battery life:** 9 hours | **Dimensions:** 6.65 x 5.31 x 2.72 inches

Pros 
* Extremely lightweight
* Rated for swimming
* Long battery life
* Comfortable

Cons 
* Doesn't support subscription services like Spotify

### Shokz OpenSwim Pro

#### Best bone conduction headphones for swimming

Avid swimmers will get a lot out of the new Shokz OpenSwim Pro if your're looking to shake up the monotony of endless laps in the pool. The OpenSwim Pro has a comfortable fit that stays on your head, a long battery, and amazing sound. "As long as you have access to your own saved music files, this headset is a solid option for waterproof beats," Matt Miller writes in his review. 

If you're new to bone conduction headphones for swimming, know these aren't like your average Bluetooth headphones. You can't connect to your phone with them and play Spotify or Apple Music in the water. Instead, the headphones operate in MP3 mode. You will load your audio files onto the OpenSwim Pro by connecting it to your computer and transferring the files over. This also means you'll need some songs in MP3 mode to get the most out of these in the water. 

Miller suggests installing the Shokz app to support standard and swimming modes. The app also works for EQ settings, multipoint pairing, physical button customization, and battery status. 

**Review:** [**Shokz OpenSwim Pro**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-best-waterproof-headphones-ive-tested-are-also-the-most-comfortable/)

Because of the design of these headphones, you can't wear them and also cover your ears with a swim cap, which is something to keep in mind if you are trying to avoid water getting into your ears as you swim. But besides that, these are highly recommendable waterproof headphones that will please any swimmer.

**Shokz OpenSwim Pro tech specs: Type:** Open ear | **Wired/wireless:** Wireless | **Waterproof rating:** IP68 | **Weight:** 27.3 oz | **Battery life:** 9 hours

### Mojawa Run Plus bone conduction headphones

#### Best Shokz OpenRun Pro dupe

ZDNET contributor Jack Wallen replaced his $180 pair of Shokz OpenRun Pros with these $160 bone conduction headphones, and he says he's pretty pleased with them. They offer a great user experience and similar sound quality to the Shokz OpenRun Pro bone conduction headphones. Plus, they can withstand sweaty workouts, which Wallen found difficult for other bone conduction headphones to achieve. You can run with these, but you can also swim with them, given their IP68 waterproof rating. 

**Review:** [**Mojawa Run Plus**](https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/home-entertainment/i-replaced-my-shokz-with-these-bone-conduction-headphones-for-one-key-reason/)

The touch controls are intuitive (and far larger than the buttons on the Shokz headphones), and the sound is great. "If you regularly exercise and produce considerable sweat (and aren't concerned about the best sound possible), these are for you. Also, if you find the Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones challenging to control, the Mojawa gear will make you very happy," Wallen writes in his review. 

A few Amazon buyers also compared the Run Plus to the OpenRun Pro and concluded that the Run Plus is a winner in most categories, like comfort, battery, and sound quality. Plus, these will suit swimmers and outdoor runners with a more robust waterproof rating than the OpenRun Pro. 

**Mojawa Run Plus tech specs: Type:** Open ear | **Wired/wireless:** Wireless | **Waterproof rating:** IP68 | **Weight:** 0.07 pounds | **Battery life:** 8 hours | **Dimensions:** 3.9 x 3.1 x 1.2 inches

Pros 
* Great, aware sound
* The most comfortable earbuds I've tried
* Great alternative to bone conduction

Cons 
* Tend to randomly disconnect from Bluetooth
* Pricey
* Doesn't fit every ear

### Bose Ultra Open Earbuds

#### Best splurge bone conduction headphones

At $300, these Bose Ultra Open earbuds won't work for everybody. But if you're a runner who prioritizes awareness and fantastic sound, these earbuds are about to become your favorite running accessory. The Ultra Open utilizes bone and air conduction to deliver music that doesn't take you out of your environment while offering fantastic sound. The design is unique, too: the earbuds cuff to your ear like a clip-on earring, and through this design, they stay put. You can move and shake your head all you want -- they won't budge. 

**Review:** [**Bose Ultra Open**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/why-i-run-with-these-bose-earbuds-instead-of-bone-conduction-headphones/)

They're the first earbuds I could wear everywhere, whether playing music or off. The design and sound make it so easy to manage environmental awareness that I kept them in while grocery shopping in a busy Trader Joe's, on the subway, and while walking home. Usually, if a pair of earbuds isn't playing, I'll remove them from my ears because they take me out of my environment. These don't. They're also pleasant to wear on long runs and can handle dust and water. 

However, one downside to these earbuds is how the connection tends to go in and out on certain occasions. People on Reddit agree and have complained about the earbuds' tendency to disconnect randomly. 

If you're interested in aware sound, want an alternative to bone conduction headphones, and are willing to pay a premium price, these are certainly worth it. 

**Bose Ultra Open earbuds specs:** **Type:** Open ear/ear cuff | **Wired/wireless:** Wireless | **Waterproof rating:** IPX4 | **Weight:** .01 pounds | **Battery life:** 7.5 hours

Cons

### Shokz OpenFit Air

#### Best open-ear alternative

ZDNET's Matt Miller ran, cycled, indoor rowed, and commuted with the Shokz OpenFit Air headphones, and he says they're a great option for people who want to ditch bone conduction headphones but still maintain awareness. The OpenFit Air improves on comfort and price from the previous model (these are somehow cheaper than the OpenFit), but what you gain in comfort and price you lose in battery life. 

**Review: [Shokz OpenFit Air](https://www.zdnet.com/article/one-of-my-favorite-open-ear-headphones-just-got-better-and-somehow-cheaper/)**

Open-ear headphones are a little different from bone conduction headphone in that they hang on your ear instead of wrapping around your head. Miller complimented the stylish touch that you get with the upgrade, and says they're a thoughtfully designed yet affordable option.

"If you're interested in keeping your ears open while working out and don't like bone-conduction headsets, I highly recommend the OpenFit Air, even over the OpenFit model with the $60 savings and very limited compromises made to achieve that lower price," Miller writes in his review of the product.

## Factors to consider when choosing bone conduction headphones

There are a few essential factors to keep in mind as you shop around for a pair of bone conduction headphones. Here are the most important ones to consider. 

* **Type:** There are many different types of bone conduction headphones, such as over-the-ear or in-ear bone conduction headphones. Do you want these headphones for swimming underwater, running outdoors in rain, or doing a little bit of both, plus some conference calls and casual listening? Everyone has a preference, and some bone conduction headphones will work wonderfully for swimming but fail at casual outdoor listening. Knowing your intended use is the first and most critical factor to consider.
* **Sound quality:** This comes as no surprise, but if you are spending $100 to $200 on a pair of headphones, they should have decent sound that isn't tinny, warbled, or muffled. Bone conduction headphones and great sound quality don't always go together, but we have tested and selected headphones that do indeed offer amazing sound quality while keeping you aware of your surroundings.
* **Battery life:** The bone conduction headphones on this list have average battery lives of 8.5 hours. If you are going to spend more than $100 on a pair of headphones, its battery life should last you more than two or three exercise sessions.
* **Sweat and waterproof rating:** If you are a swimmer, consider a waterproof rating of IP68\. If you are an outdoors runner who exercises in inclement weather (or just sweats a lot) look for a waterproof rating of at least IP55\.
* **Cost:** From $30 to $200, the bone conduction headphones on this list range in price. But you are getting what you pay for. As mentioned in the listicles above, a cheaper pair of headphones will have shorter battery life and longevity, while a more expensive pair will last you longer and be more durable.

ZDNET went hands-on with most of the picks on this list, and we are constantly testing the newest and hottest tech to update these recommendations accordingly. When we test a product, we typically spend a few weeks if not longer trying it out in multiple environments before writing up a review and adding it to this list. When we don't like a product, we won't include it on this list (because who wants to read a review of a faulty headphone?). For these headphones, our contributors have gone on runs and swam in them, putting them to the test in varying conditions to see just how well they can perform. 

We know that investing in technology can be expensive, so we keep in mind price, performance, user experience, customer reviews, longevity, and battery life, and only recommend products we would actually use ourselves.

## What are bone conduction headphones and how do they work?

Panasonic/ZDNET

Bone conduction headphones use vibrations to transmit sound waves directly to the inner ear, bypassing the eardrum. Unlike in-ear buds or over-ear headphones, which seal in sounds and transmit noise that vibrates from the eardrum and to the cochlea (the part of your ear that responds to noise), bone conduction headphones work by emitting vibrations that avoid the eardrum and go straight to the cochlea, SoundGuys writer Lily Katz explained [in a recent article](https://www.soundguys.com/bone-conduction-headphones-20580/). 

It was Beethoven himself who pioneered this music-listening method. When his hearing was deteriorating, Beethoven would put the end of a stick on his piano and bite the other side of it to feel the music come through his jaw, and hear without his ears, according [to ZME Science](https://www.zmescience.com/feature-post/pieces/how-a-deaf-beethoven-discovered-bone-conduction-by-attaching-a-rod-to-his-piano-and-clenching-it-in-his-teeth/). 

These headphones typically sit on the cheekbones and use a small transducer to send vibrations through the bones of the face to the inner ear. This allows users to hear the audio clearly, while still being able to hear their surroundings. This can be useful for people who work in noisy environments or for those who are hard of hearing. They also can be used for people who are unable to wear traditional headphones due to physical conditions.

This unique engineering of bone conduction headphones might reduce the inner-ear trauma of [jamming out with earbuds](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-prevent-hearing-loss-caused-by-headphones/).

## Are bone conduction headphones waterproof?

Not all bone conduction headphones are waterproof, so it is important to check the waterproof or water-resistant rating on a set before making a purchase. If you want a pair of waterproof bone conduction headphones that you can swim in, look for a rating of IP68.

## How much do bone conduction headphones cost?

Bone conduction headphones can vary significantly in price, depending on the manufacturer and model that you choose. Our picks for the best bone conduction headphones range in cost from $30 to $200 each.

## Are bone conduction headphones worth it?

Due to their design, they aren't the premium headphone option for audio quality. But chances are you aren't seeking them out for audio quality purposes. Bone conduction headphones, thanks to an open design, can help overall hearing health and increase environmental awareness. 

For example, Dr. Kelvin Fernandez, a physician and healthcare educator at [Ace Med Boards](https://acemedboards.com/), calls them a real game-changer in the medical realm and cites a time they helped his patient, an up-and-coming musician suffering from hearing loss. "They let him keep doing what he loved. It was a real emotional win and a perfect example of how tech can make life better," Fernandez said. 

## Did Aftershokz rebrand?

Aftershokz products are still around and thriving, but today, they are known as Shokz after a December 2021 rebranding. One of Aftershokz's top products and our best bone conduction headphones for beginners, the Aftershokz Aeropex, is now known as the Shokz OpenRun.

## Other bone conduction headphones we tested

Outside of these six bone conduction headphones, there are also a handful of others that caught our attention. Brands like AfterShokz and Pyle Bone make great alternative choices. We've gone hands on with these bone conduction headphones as well if the ones above don't suit your fancy.
