## What is the best laptop in 2024?

Our pick for the overall best laptop in 2024 is the [MacBook Pro (M3 Max)](https://shop-links.co/link/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-macbook-pro-14-laptop-m3-max-chip-36gb-memory-30-core-gpu-1tb-ssd-latest-model-space-black%2F6534620.p%3FskuId%3D6534620&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&exclusive=1). It's hard to beat the MacBook Pro's 22-hour battery life, its suite of powerful hardware, and its gorgeous 120Hz refresh rate display, all in a super portable and sleek package. This is a laptop that checks off all the boxes and looks as good as it performs.

## MacBook Pro (M3 Max)

### Best laptop overall

ZDNET's editor-in-chief Jason Hiner called the MacBook Pro M3 Max a "desktop-class laptop" when he first tested it, and that description holds up today. The performance of this beast of a laptop easily rivals other desktops, including Apple's own Mac Studio. 

Speaking about creative tasks, the M3 Max can take sizeable RAW image files, process them through Adobe Photoshop's AI Denoise feature, and remove their graininess in less than 20 seconds. That's less than half as long as it would take on a MacBook Pro sporting an M1 Pro chip.

**Review: [MacBook Pro (M3 Max)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/macbook-pro-m3-max-review/)**

The MacBook Pro M3 Max's performance is pushed even further thanks to its GPU's unique architecture called Dynamic Caching, a more sophisticated form of graphics memory allocation. This allows for faster mesh shading, enabling high-quality graphics, better rendering, and even ray tracing, which you usually only see on high-end graphics cards. It also allows for more "photorealistic" lightning, perfect for enhancing immersion.

The accolades don't stop there. The MacBook Pro M3 Max sports a stunning display capable of outputting a 120Hz refresh and 1,600 nits of peak brightness for a level of clarity people have been asking for a long time. Plus, it's very power efficient, allowing it to last up to 22 hours with a low-end configuration. You can activate High-Power Mode to have it fire off on all cylinders when unplugged.

If it wasn't already clear, the MacBook Pro M3 Max is a monster. Even though it's not the newest laptop on this list, it's poised to take on the next generation of AI-powered tasks thanks to the powerful M3 chip on board and solid hardware.

**MacBook Pro M3 Max features: Display size:** 14-inch and 16-inch | **Display type:** Liquid Retina XDR | **Resolution:** 3456 x 2234 pixels | **RAM:** Up to 128GB | **Storage:** Up to 8TB | **CPU:** 14-core M3 Max | **Battery life:** Up to 22 hours

## LG Gram Pro 16 2-in-1

### Best lightweight laptop

LG's Gram Pro 16 2-in-1 is light -- so light, in fact, that it currently holds the Guinness record for being the lightest 16-inch 2-in-1 in the world. This is an impressive feat, considering its powerful hardware and gorgeous OLED display. 

**Review: [LG Gram Pro 16 2-in-1](https://www.zdnet.com/article/our-favorite-lightweight-laptop-for-work-is-not-a-macbook-or-thinkpad/)**

The thin, sleek matte black body of the Gram Pro belies a machine that's powerful enough for a variety of use cases, from productivity to creative tasks. Its 2-in-1 form factor allows for flexibility as a tablet or while watching media in tent mode, and in an apparent effort to defy its lightweight form factor, the Gram Pro can also come with a massive 2TB storage capacity. 

The touchscreen and addition of the stylus make this device especially well-suited for a variety of work environments, and its ultra-portability and its high-end keyboard and trackpad combo make it a laptop that's a joy to commute or travel with. 

**LG Gram Pro 16 2-in-1 features: Display size:** 16 inches | **Display type:** OLED | **Resolution:** 2880 x 1800 VRR OLED Touchscreen | **RAM:** Up to 32GB | **Storage:** Up to 2TB SSD | **CPU:** Intel Core Ultra 7 155H | **GPU:** Intel Arc | **Battery life:** 8 hours of video playback | **Weight:** 3.04 lbs

## Dell XPS 16

### Best Windows laptop

With so many fantastic Windows laptops out there, it was hard to pick just one, but we had to give it to the XPS 16\. It is such a good computer. We feel confident that it's good enough to become your primary device. Dell's machine has a stunning 4K resolution display surrounded by thin bezels. Having a thin frame is a slight touch, but it makes the screen seem significantly more prominent than it is.

**Review: [Dell XPS 16 (2024)](https://www.zdnet.com/article/dell-xps-16-2024-review/)**

Under the hood, you're looking at an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series graphics card. Our review unit came with an RTX 4070 GPU. Combine these specs with its 32GB of RAM (64GB max), and you're looking at a laptop that can easily handle all demanding workloads, from gaming to video editing.

The XPS 16's also has a stylish design. The zero lattice keyboard and the function key touch panel give it a distinct look seen nowhere else. On the sides of the keys are the device's room-filling speakers. We want to warn you that the XPS 16 is rather heavy and doesn't have a wide array of ports so that you may need a docking station. Be sure to check out ZDNET's list of the [best laptop docking stations](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-laptop-docking-station/) for recommendations.

**Dell XPS 16 features: Display size:** 16.3 inches | **Display type:** OLED | **Resolution:** 4K | **CPU:** Intel Core Ultra 7 155H | **RAM:** Up to 64GB | **Storage:** Up to 4TB SSD | **Battery life:** 12 hours

Pros 
* Powerful suite of hardware
* Massive display
* Tons of storage
* Future-proofed to handle upcoming titles

Cons 
* Expensive
* Loud, powerful fans
* Heavy and bulky
* Best while plugged in

## Alienware m18 R2

### Best gaming laptop

Dell's Alienware m18 R2 is a top-tier gaming laptop that runs upwards of $3,000, but it's well worth the cost. This is a beastly, high-powered laptop that is designed for one thing: immersive gaming. As the refresh of last year's m18 r1 model, the R2 is a powerful, top-of-the-line gamer's paradise stacked with a 14th-generation HX Intel 24-core 5.8 GHz max boost processor, high-end graphics capabilities, a sophisticated cooling system, and more ports than you'll know what to do with.

**Review:** [**I tested Dell's $3,000 gaming laptop and it spoiled me with unconventional features**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-tested-dells-3000-gaming-laptop-and-it-spoiled-me-with-unconventional-features/)

Despite its colossal size, the m18 R2 is very comfortable to use. The touchpad is minimalistic and responsive, and the luxe Cherry MX mechanical keyboard feels exactly as satisfying as you'd expect, with each key getting the proper tactile "click" that feels the same no matter where on the key you press. 

[Dell's Alienware m18 R2](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Flinks%2F9041660%2Ftype%2Fdlg%2Fsid%2Fzd-%255F%255FCOM%255FCLICK%255FID%255F%255F-dtp%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fgaming-laptops%2Falienware-m18-r2-gaming-laptop%2Fspd%2Falienware-m18-r2-laptop%2F) is right at the top of the line when it comes to the [best gaming laptops](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-gaming-laptop/). This is a powerful machine with a distinct identity that can handle virtually any game you want, with vibrant graphics and blazing fast speeds. Plus, it can get dressed for the office at the press of a button.

**Alienware m18 R2 tech specs: Display size:** 18 inches | **Display type:** QHD | **Resolution:** 2560 x 1600 | **CPU:** 14th Gen Intel Core i9 | **GPU:** Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090, 16GB | **RAM:** 16GB-64GB | **Storage:** 1TB-8TB SSD | **Battery life:** 10 hours

## Acer Aspire Go 15

### Best laptop under $500

We're calling the Acer Aspire Go 15 the best laptop under $500, but it's actually well under that price. For just $300, this is a capable laptop at a price you can't argue with. Not everyone needs a powerful laptop decked out in high-end hardware, especially if you're looking for a secondary computer. And for a portable notebook that is built to cover the basics, it doesn't get much more affordable than this. 

The Acer Aspire Go 15 is offered at such a low cost because it has just 8GB of RAM and 125GB SSD. This means it's not a device you want to dump all your photos and videos on. Instead, you can use it as a capable machine for work or staying connected while traveling.

**Review:** [**This $299 Windows laptop is my new go-to recommendation for budget shoppers**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-299-windows-laptop-is-my-new-go-to-recommendation-for-budget-shoppers/)

The 15-inch screen gives enough room for working with spreadsheets and productivity software, where the full keyboard features a number pad on the right side. Add in a webcam, a good selection of ports, and a Kensington lock slot, and this laptop has your bases covered. 

**Acer Aspire Go tech specs: Display size:** 15 inches | **Display type:** LCD | **Resolution:** 1080p | **CPU:** Intel Core i3-N305 | **RAM:** 8GB | **Storage:** 125GB SSD | **Battery life:** Up to 11 hours

### Best laptop for content creators

I didn't pay much attention to this laptop when I first heard of it. But the second I went hands-on, I realized I had massively underestimated the Asus Vivobook Pro 15\. This is a fantastic laptop with a brilliant OLED display, solid hardware, and a suite of features made with creators in mind, all for a very competitive price. 

In fact, the price point is one of the main draws here, as it's not hard to find laptops targeted at creators for double the price, but the Vivobook Pro 15 offers quite a lot of bang for your buck. Armed with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU and Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, it's well-suited for multitasking and running graphics-intensive programs with ease. 

**Review:** [**Asus Vivobook Pro 15 (2024)**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-asus-laptop-looks-unassuming-but-it-has-a-powerful-feature-creatives-will-love/)

The OLED screen is supported by an array of image-enhancing software, the most notable of which is the Pantone validation, which allows the display to accurately represent colors with the utmost accuracy to true life, a rather rare feature on laptops. 

The trackpad also has an ingenious feature called the DialPad that acts as a quick menu for toolkits found in creative software. Through its control app, you can connect it to Photoshop and then tie it to different brushes, tools, layer navigation, or other commonly-used features with convenient one-click gestures.

**Asus Vivobook Pro 15 (2024) features: Display size:** 15 inches | **Display type:** OLED | **Resolution:** 1920 x 1080 | **CPU:** Intel Core Ultra 7 155H | **RAM:** 16GB | **Storage:** 1TB SSD | **Battery life:** 6 hours

## Which is the right laptop for you?

The main question when buying a laptop is: "What do you want to do with it?" Once you've established that, you can focus your research on finding the right machine for you.

For example, if you're on the move a lot, you'll want a good combination of flexibility, sturdiness, connectivity, security, and a long battery life. However, if you're a largely deskbound graphic designer or content creator, you should opt for a laptop with powerful hardware. Devices with top-tier processors and graphics cards tend to be heavier than most.

Here's a well-researched (and tested) list of our favorite laptops for a wide array of use cases. 

| **Buy** **this** **best** **laptop...** | **If** **you** **need...**                                                                                                                                                         |

## How we test laptops

Kyle Kucharski/ZDNET

We use a combination of methods to test laptops here at ZDNET. First, we acquire data from benchmarking software to analyze a system's metrics under the hood and compare those to advertised numbers. Then, we spend an extended amount of time with the laptop (usually a week or two) using it the same way a normal consumer would, to assess its portability, form factor, and how well the battery _actually_ holds up. For an extensive breakdown, check out our comprehensive [laptop testing methodology](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-we-test-laptops/).

* **Benchmarking:** First, we run a series of tests to put the computer's hardware through the wringer in order to see what it's capable of. [Cinebench](https://www.maxon.net/en/downloads/cinebench-2024-downloads) is one of the most commonly used hardware testing suites, which tests the laptop's rendering performance on single and multiple CPU cores. [PCMark 10](https://benchmarks.ul.com/pcmark10) is another powerful program that covers a wide variety of tasks performed in the workplace, and there are many others that we use in tandem to gather as much data as we can. Some components we run tests on include:
* **Processor:** The "brain" of the laptop and one of the most important factors that determines performance. The four biggest manufacturers that make most of the CPUs found in laptops today are Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, and Apple (in Apple machines only). This is tested in benchmarking software.
* **The display:** The size of the display (measured diagonally from corner to corner) is also what dictates the laptop's overall size, and plays a big role in the laptop's cost. Brightness is measured in "nits," and color spectrums are tested in benchmarking software.
* **The graphics processor (GPU):** Whether it's integrated into the CPU or a dedicated graphics card, how well the machine handles graphics is a key factor when it comes to demanding tasks like video editing, rendering, and of course, gaming. We test the GPU with a combination of benchmarking software, gaming, and media playback.
* **Physical form factor:** Finally, the laptop's overall appearance and physical form factor encompasses its weight, thickness, how the keyboard and trackpad feel, and whether it has a display that can be folded back to form a tablet. We carry the laptop around for at least a week and note how well it commutes.
* **Battery testing:** We test a unit's battery in a few ways. A handful of benchmarking programs have their own battery testing components, but we also will just let the laptop run for as long as it can under a medium load. We ensure screensavers and hibernation mode are turned off, set the display's brightness and audio at 50%, load up a livestream on YouTube in Chrome, and wait 'til the end.
* **The human element:**  As we mentioned earlier, metrics and system data is important, but numbers alone don't give you the full picture. This is where we weave in our personal experience with the device and tap into the practical use cases that consumers actually care about.

Ultimately, our goal is to break down the capabilities of each and every laptop we test into digestible terms that real people find useful. There is a lot of noise and confusion when it comes to navigating the laptop and computer consumer market, so we hope to bring an intuitive element to the whole process by leveraging our team's decades of experience.

## What are some factors to consider when choosing the best laptops?

Multiple factors influence the choice of laptops for this list. We look for machines with great designs, performance, and effective storage and RAM. We also considered the different purposes for which you may need or use your laptop and the overall value (including the price point) that the laptop promises. 

* **Design:** Whether your laptop is your ultimate workstation or source of entertainment, its design, display, and portability determine how you interact with the unit.
* **Performance:** For many, laptops are essential for workflow and communication. The best laptops promise efficient speed and performance, powered by the greatest and latest chipsets (like the Apple M3 Max).
* **Storage and RAM:** It's likely you'll use a laptop to store key documents or memories, and the best models have plenty of room for you to do so.
* **Purpose:** We strive to answer the question, "What laptop should I get if \_\_\_" as we know you have different workflow and entertainment needs and preferences, from graphic design to gaming.
* **Value:** The best laptop can be a pricey investment, so we considered qualities that assure you'll get your money's worth.

## Why should you buy a laptop, and not a desktop or a tablet?

While the desktop form factor, especially in the form of all-in-one (AIO) devices, still exists, laptops come in various sizes and cover many use cases. They range from thin, light, and ultraportable to bulky, powerful, and deskbound. Because of how good laptops are nowadays, most people opt for sticking with a laptop to serve as their main computer. If a small laptop screen is an issue, an external monitor can be connected.

## Which operating system should you choose: Windows, MacOS, ChromeOS, or Linux?

While every computing platform has its loyal supporters, most people end up using a particular operating system because of key applications running on it, employer preferences, or budgetary constraints. Windows, which ranges from budget to premium, and Apple's MacOS, which is exclusive to premium devices, cover a broad spectrum. ChromeOS is mostly limited to mid-range devices.

**Also: [The best lightweight laptops you can buy: Expert tested](https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-lightweight-laptops/)**

All Windows devices listed here meet the requirements for Windows 11\. If you purchase a device with Windows 10 installed, you will be able to upgrade to Windows 11 if you choose to do so. Note that after October 14, 2025, Windows 10 support will end, and there will be no further security patches or feature updates.

## What brand of laptop is best?

In general, the leading PC vendors have the most extensive range of offerings and the best-documented track records for product development and customer relations. Therefore, if you do not have a specialized use case or budgetary constraints, you will typically consider vendors such as Lenovo, HP, Dell, Apple, or Asus. These vendors currently lead the PC market in terms of shipments, along with several other well-known brands.

You'll also want something with at least an 8-hour battery life to get through a typical school day without needing to plug in (which is excellent for younger kids who may be forgetful and leave their charging cable at home). Also look for a laptop with at least 4GB of RAM, 256GB of storage, and cloud-storage backup to create duplicate copies of important files and classwork. You'll also want to avoid laptops with dedicated graphics cards aimed toward gaming to help cut down misuse and procrastination

## What are the best laptops for business?

Whether you're looking for a single laptop for yourself or a fleet for your business, the best laptops for work not only offer great performance but also multiple connectivity options and durable builds. 

You'll want to look for a model that has at least 8GB of RAM, a 512GB storage drive, a quad-core CPU, and a display that is large enough to work on without being too bulky to travel with. You'll also want a model with, at least, 8 hours of battery life to get through a typical shift without needing to plug in.

## What are the best laptops for video editing?

We strongly recommend getting a [MacBook Pro (M3 Max)](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch?tag=zdnet-deals-20) and purchasing [Final Cut Pro](https://www.zdnet.com/article/final-cut-pro-on-the-ipad-a-surprisingly-touching-experience/), an editing software exclusive to the Mac ecosystem. There's also the option of buying the 16-inch MacBook Pro from early 2023\. It sports an M2 Max chip and offers great performance for content creators.

**Review:** [**Apple 16-inch MacBook Pro (M2 Max, 2023): A content creator's dream machine**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/apple-macbook-pro-m2-max-review/)
