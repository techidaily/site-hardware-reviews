## Expertly Selected Leading Security Devices for 202E: Comprehensive Analysis

A strong password and username combination is not enough to keep your online accounts secure. 

With data breaches becoming a daily occurrence, many online service providers now offer alternative ways to secure accounts. Two-factor and multi-factor authentication (2FA/MFA) methods have become widely adopted alongside early passwordless authentication methods. Still, sometimes, you may also need to verify yourself using a physical security key. 

Even if a cybercriminal has obtained your username and password or compromised your mobile device, they won't be able to access your data without having the key in hand. Not only are security keys affordable and user-friendly, but they also prevent phishing attacks and are significantly more secure than SMS-based two-factor authentication.

### Best security key for durability

The FIDO2 is a USB-A key that functions with the latest Chrome browser and operating systems such as Windows, macOS, or Linux. This option also has backward compatibility with online services complying with U2F protocols.

FIDO2 provides passwordless authentication using the FIDO and HOTP protocols. You'll find the most compatibility with desktop and PC applications as there are marginally more restrictions with iOS and Android functionality.

## Yubico Security Key C NFC

### Best security key for businesses

An alternative Yubico security key is the $29 C NFC model. The USB-C key is best suited for businesses that want to implement physical 2FA procedures without spending a fortune. 

The key is compatible with Android, Windows 10, and iOS devices, as well as services such as AWS, Okta, Google accounts, Apple iCloud, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Cloudflare.

These "tap and go" models do not support the Yubico Authenticator app. Instead, they have been designed for affordability and rapid security checks via USB-C, NFC, and FIDO protocols (a 5 series is best suited if you want more extensive features). 

The company also offers a Yubico subscription to businesses that want to provide their teams with keys, so this could be the best solution for businesses that need to provide their teams with physical security keys. Customers say the key 'just works', but customer support could be improved.

**Yubico Security Key C NFC features:** FIDO certified, FIDO2/U2F compatible | USB-C | NFC connectivity | No battery required | Suitable for Android, Windows 10, iOS devices and apps | Defends against phishing and account takeovers

### The best security key for biometrics

The Kensington Verimark Fingerprint Key utilizes advanced biometric technology, offering excellent performance, 360-degree readability, and anti-spoofing protection.

With Microsoft's built-in Windows Hello login feature, you can log into your Windows computer using just your fingerprint. Users can store up to 10 fingerprints, allowing multiple individuals to access the same computer without remembering different usernames or passwords.

The Kensington Verimark Fingerprint Key is FIDO U2F certified, meaning your fingerprint can be used as a second-factor authentication to secure cloud-based accounts such as Google, Dropbox, GitHub, and Facebook.

You may need to download additional drivers from Kensington's website for different Windows operating systems, and some users report recognition problems. However, it is still a top choice -- especially as the key is available for only $19 rather than its typical $45 RRP.

## Google Titan security key

### The best multi-platform security key

The Google Titan security key line, recently updated to include support for up to 250 passkeys, is an affordable way to bolster your online security. The $30 key is USB-C-compatible and a USB-C to USB-A adapter is included for legacy devices. 

This stylish option is based on FIDO standards, and it can connect most Android and iOS devices, as well as most devices able to run Google Chrome. If you're looking for a key suitable for most platforms, this key is for you—and as a bonus, it is well-priced.

Titan security keys are compatible with Google's Advanced Protection Program, a scheme you may be required to join if you are considered at higher risk of cyberattacks -- including phishing and email-based attacks -- than the average consumer. Compatibility requirements are listed [here](https://support.google.com/titansecuritykey/answer/9115487?hl=en&ref%5Ftopic=9115486#zippy=About). Setup is easy, but we've found that, on occasion, you may end up in verification loops when you try to register a new device with your key.

## What's the right security key for you?

It all boils down to which features you prioritize and your budget. Since having two security keys is recommended for added security, with one in use and the other as a backup, choosing a more affordable option could be cost-effective. 

However, investing in a higher-end brand may be wise if you already use security keys or anticipate frequent use.

## Factors to consider when choosing a security key

Security keys are an investment in time and money and so it is best to select the right one for you before you begin the process of connecting one to your online accounts. While you're deciding what security key is right for you, consider the following factors:

* **Service compatibility**: Ensure that the key you're interested in is compatible with your primary services, such as your email provider or business tools and platforms.
* **One, or two?**: We recommend that you purchase a key and a backup. You can often buy two packs of security keys, but in some cases, you may have to spend more.
* **Security standards**: Security keys should adhere to modern security standards, including FIDO2\. Check that your choice meets these standards to ensure you receive the best protection possible.
* **Connectivity:** Hardware-based security keys use different forms of connectivity, so you should consider what type works best for you, whether USB-based, Bluetooth, or NFC.
* **Hardware**: You might need hardware that complies with particular standards or has specific ports for connecting to your devices, so check on your key's specifications prior to purchase.
* **Price**: Choose a security key that matches your budget.

## How were these security keys chosen?

Extensive research has been conducted on every security key that is listed here across a wide range of devices and services. In some cases, this includes testing the keys on different operating systems, web browsers, and services to ensure they work smoothly and efficiently.

It was also important to analyze the feedback left by other users who have purchased and used these keys over a period of time. This has helped to determine the long-term reliability of each key and to identify any potential compatibility issues that users might encounter. 

Our main criteria for selecting these security keys are: 

* **Ease of use**: There is often a learning curve associated with adopting a new security mechanism or gadget. We wanted to ensure that the next security key you buy is as close to seamless as possible, with easy setup and reasonable compatibility with devices and online services.
* **Durability**: As a physical device securing the keys to your digital kingdom, it is crucial that the products we recommend won't easily break. After all, they should be reliable enough to be a long-term security measure.
* **Security features**: Naturally, the security features of a security key are paramount. We considered each device's support for different authentication protocols alongside security measures including passwordless authentication.
* **Price point**: The cost of your next security key is an important factor to consider. As they are physical, we recommend that you pick up two, just in case one ends up lost. As a result, we wanted to ensure this was affordable.

## What are security keys and how do they work?

A security key is a physical device that generates a unique code used with a password to authenticate your identity when logging into a website or application. It uses public-key cryptography and is more secure than traditional 2FA methods.

## What does FIDO mean?

The FIDO Alliance consortium has developed open standards for authentication protocols. The authentication standard is based on public key cryptography. 

Devices that are FIDO certified allow users to quickly sign into their accounts using physical keys or biometric passkeys, and have also achieved FIDO protection and security standards. 

## Why are security keys better than SMS-based 2FA?

SMS is open to SIM hijacking, while a physical key cannot be copied or the data intercepted. Think about it this way: 2FA verification codes sent via SMS messaging may be intercepted if your smartphone has been infected with malware, including spyware, but unless an attacker has your physical security key in their hand, they cannot grab the code required to access your account.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## How many security keys do I need?

We recommend purchasing at least two -- one that you use day-to-day and one to keep as a backup. For example, you can keep one in your home office or attached to a keychain if you're on the road, while one is stashed safely away to cover you if you lose your primary key.

## Can security keys be hacked?

Security keys are one of the best authentication methods on the market today and they have very little exploitable attack surface, making them difficult to 'hack' in any way. While there are cases of keys being cloned for academic purposes, as security keys are not constantly connected to the Internet, you don't have to worry about the most common attack vectors having any impact on them. Just keep your key in a safe place.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## How do security keys prevent phishing?

In layman's terms, security keys use encryption and security tokens that only work on genuine websites rather than fake phishing domains. Public and private keys work together to authenticate a user session, but the private key is held on the physical device, reducing the attack surface.
